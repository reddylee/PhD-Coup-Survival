\begin{abstract}
This study endeavors to conduct an in-depth analysis of the determinants
impacting the survival of political leadership that has ascended to
power, either through coups or overstays. Utilizing a survival model,
the research investigates the influence of factors such as political
stability, military control, economic performance, external alliances,
regime types, and levels of democracy on the endurance of political
leaders. Employing a quantitative approach with a novel dataset
encompassing coups and overstays, this research makes a significant
contribution to existing literature by providing valuable insights into
the factors shaping political survival for leaders who assume office or
maintain power through unconstitutional means.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In political science, a compelling enigma persists: why do certain
leaders manage to cling to power for three or four decades, while others
find their tenures cut short after just several years, or even mere
months or days? This intriguing question has been extensively explored
in numerous existing works
\citep[\citet{buenodemesquita2003}]{clinton1975politics}. Some of these
works encompass leaders across diverse political landscapes, spanning
democracies and autocracies, parliamentary and presidential systems, as
well as civilian and military contexts \citep{buenodemesquita2003}.
Others narrow their focus to specific types of regimes, delving into
democracies \citep{svolik2014} or autocracies \citep{davenport2021}.

However, a significant number of political leaders, particularly in
democracies and some in autocracies, undergo regular and predictable
tenures. A prime example is found in the United States, where presidents
may stay in the White House for up to eight years if they perform well
and secure a second term. Even in cases of poor performance, they
typically complete a full four-year term. Another illustration can be
drawn from autocratic Mexico between 1919 and 2000, where each president
served a fixed six-year term without facing overthrows or overstays. In
such scenarios, analyzing the survival of these leaders seems futile, as
power transitions from one political leader to the next are typically
observed within the framework of constitutional rules or unwritten
conventions.

Therefore, the central emphasis on political longevity should center
around leaders who stay in power for unforeseen duration. In theory,
such situations can happen in any political context. Even in the United
States, one of the most regular power transition countries, President
Trump, following his electoral defeat, attempted to extend his tenure by
contesting the outcome of the general election. However, the predominant
instances of unexpected political tenures revolve around leaders who
either seize power through coups or overstay through unconstitutional
means---this constitutes the core focus of this paper.

The analysis of their tenures is particularly significant for two
reasons. Firstly, the duration of these leaders' tenures exhibits
considerable variation, ranging from mere months to several decades.
Secondly, predicting the tenures of such leaders proves challenging. A
seemingly robust and stable regime can collapse suddenly overnight,
while an apparently fragile one might persist for decades. The
substantial disparities in these tenures remain inadequately explained,
posing a perplexing challenge and attracting the attention of numerous
political scientists.

Building upon discussions surrounding coups and incumbent overstays,
this paper delves into the trajectories of political leaders who
ascended to power through coups or overstayed their intended terms. The
primary focus lies in unraveling the duration of these leaders' tenures
and understanding the underlying determinants.

This paper follows a structured approach as outlined below: The second
section encompasses a comprehensive literature review on political
survival and highlighting the contributions of this paper might offer.
The third chapter delves into the examination of factors influencing the
survival of leaders who have ascended to power through unconstitutional
means. Chapter 4 provides an account of the methodology and data
employed, utilizing a survival model for a comprehensive analysis of the
determinants of leaders' survival. The subsequent chapter, Chapter 5,
presents the findings of this analysis, facilitating an in-depth
discussion of the results. Finally, in Chapter 6, the paper concludes by
synthesizing these findings and exploring their broader implications.

\hypertarget{literature-review}{%
\section{Literature review}\label{literature-review}}

Prior research concerning the longevity of political leaders has
predominantly concentrated on two primary facets. One dimension revolves
around the contextual conditions and resources available to leaders,
including factors like personal competence \citep{yu2016}, the stability
of their society \citep{arriola2009}, economic performance
\citep[\citet{williams2011}]{palmer1999}, access to natural resources
\citep{smith2004, quirozflores2012}, and external support networks
\citep[\citet{thyne2017}]{licht2009, wright2008}. The other dimension
delves into the strategies employed by leaders in enacting their
political and economic policies \citep{gandhi2007, morrison2009}, as
well as their responses to challenges and dissent within their regimes
\citep{escribà-folch2013, davenport2021}.

The duration for which political leaders can maintain their hold on
power is, to a significant extent, influenced by the manner in which
they ascended to leadership positions. It's conceivable that leaders who
engage in regular and constitutional transitions of power are more
likely to voluntarily step down as their terms expire, while those who
came to power through unconstitutional means are at a higher risk of
being unexpectedly removed from office. Much of the existing research on
the relationship between coups and the survival of leadership primarily
focuses on strategies to prevent coups {[}@powell2017; @sudduth2017;
@debruin2020{]} or how leaders can prolong their stay in power after
surviving failed coup attempts {[}@easton2018{]}. Unfortunately, there
is a limited emphasis on the study of leadership survival in the context
of successful coups. A similar gap in research attention exists
concerning incumbents who overstay their terms in power.

In their seminal work, \citet{buenodemesquita2003} introduce and expound
upon the selectorate theory of politics. This theory centers on the
analysis of leadership survival based on the concept of a sufficiently
large winning coalition (\(W\)) within the selectorate (\(S\)). The
selectorate, which encompasses individuals with the authority to
determine leadership, contrasts with the winning coalition, signifying
the minimum number of selectorate members required to secure power. In
this framework, the endurance of political leaders depends on the
maintenance of a supportive winning coalition. Winning coalitions,
driven by the pursuit of benefits, opt to back incumbents, but their
allegiance may shift towards challengers if they anticipate greater
advantages from a change in leadership.

However, two critical issues arise within this framework. Firstly, in
democracies, while those who support and vote for incumbents may see
their preferred policies enacted, those who vote against them still face
the same policies. For example, individuals casting their votes for a
candidate in favor of lower taxes confront the same tax rates as those
who vote against the incumbents. This doesn't translate into lower taxes
for supporters and higher taxes for opponents; rather, both groups face
identical tax levels. Consequently, we cannot assert that winning
coalitions inherently gain a significant advantage over the broader
selectorate. Secondly, in many autocratic regimes, the process of
leadership selection remains shrouded in secrecy. In countries like
China, the mechanisms for appointing leaders resemble a black box, with
outsiders left unaware of the rules and procedures. Expressing
dissenting views, whether as potential challengers or supporters of
challengers, is fraught with danger. In Russia, despite the presence of
general elections, challengers often face perilous consequences,
including assassination, poisoning, imprisonment, or exile.

\section{Theories}\label{theories}}

The survival of political leaders following coups or overstays may hinge
on six pivotal factors:

\hypertarget{coups-vs.-overstays}{%
\subsection{Coups vs.~overstays}\label{coups-vs.-overstays}}

Survival in power relies significantly on the cohesion of the ruling
group. As numerous scholars have pointed out, internal conflicts among
elites pose a more serious threat to the stability of those in power.
Coups often lay bare the fractures within a regime, not only attracting
more followers to orchestrate new coups but also emboldening external
challengers, including uprisings, revolutions, and civil wars. On the
other hand, successful tenures unmistakably showcase the incumbents'
firm grasp on power, discouraging both internal dissent and external
threats \citep{dahl2023}.

\textbf{Hypothesis 1 (H1):} Political leaders who successfully extend
their time in power are more likely to have prolonged survival compared
to leaders who assume power through coups.

\hypertarget{regime-types}{%
\subsection{Regime types}\label{regime-types}}

In the majority of cases, regimes following coups or prolonged stays
tend to be non-democratic. Democratic leaders are generally anticipated
to relinquish power in a regular and cyclical manner. Conversely, for
non-democratic leaders, the duration of their tenures is heavily
influenced by the type of autocracy. The three primary autocratic
regimes are dominant party, military, and personal.

Within the military regime, leaders often encounter more challenges
during their tenures. The ability to challenge incumbents, particularly
those within ruling groups, relies significantly on the support of
military forces. In dominant party or personal regimes, the military
typically operates under the control of party or personal leaders, who
are the incumbents themselves. Unlike military regimes, where generals
often play significant roles in politics, there are typically many
generals in dominant party or personal regimes, acting as checks and
balances on each other. Military regimes, however, with their powerful
army leaders and more influential generals, are more prone to political
interference and internal conflicts, leading to shorter tenures for
leaders in such regimes.

Hypothesis 2 (H2): Leaders in dominant party or personal regimes are
expected to have longer survival periods than those in military regimes.

\hypertarget{societal-stability}{%
\subsection{Societal stability}\label{societal-stability}}

\textbf{Hypothesis 3 (H3):} Political leaders presiding over stable
societies are likely to experience longer tenures.

\hypertarget{purges-and-repressions}{%
\subsection{Purges and repressions}\label{purges-and-repressions}}

\textbf{Hypothesis 4 (H4):} Leaders who are more prone to employ
stringent repression against dissidents are expected to have longer
survival durations.

\hypertarget{external-alliances}{%
\subsection{External alliances}\label{external-alliances}}

\textbf{Hypothesis 5 (H5):} Leaders with strong external alliances are
anticipated to have extended survival periods.

\hypertarget{economic-performance}{%
\subsection{Economic performance}\label{economic-performance}}

\textbf{Hypothesis 6 (H6):} Leaders with a robust economic performance
are likely to endure longer than their counterparts facing economic
crises.
