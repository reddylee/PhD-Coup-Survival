of course, never reach their destination? First, at the 874th meeting on 27 September last, the representative of Guatemala spoke of 2,000 soldiers who were being trained in the Province of Camaguey with a view to invading Guatemala. I denied the fantastic statement, and repeated to this Assembly that the Revolutionary Government of Cuba has said again and again that it is unshakably attached to the principle of non-intervention. I added, without ironical intention: "The representative of Guatemala may rest assured—there are no 2,000 soldiers being trained in Camaguey for an invasion of Guatemala."181.	There was no more talk by the delegation of Guatemala about the 2,000 soldiers in training in Camaguey, and we were happy to have been able to calm the Guatemalan delegation. But The New York Times of 4 October last carried a report that a schooner, flying no flag, and named "La Cubana", had been sighted in Guatemalan territorial waters off the Atlantic coast. According to the report in The New York Times
—and the information of the Guatemalan Government goes no further than what is contained in that report—the airforce obliged the schooner to withdraw from territorial waters, and it was seen on the following day near the island of Cotzumel, listing to port. We are not surprised that this incident inflamed the sensitive Guatemalan imagination. It was immediately said that the schooner was carrying arms and that its arrival was being awaited by the communists. Another version by the Guatemalan Government was that the schooner constituted the vanguard of a fleet organized for the purpose of invading Guatemala and overthrowing its Government. We are truly sorry to have to trouble the General Assembly in connexion with this further complaint by Guatemala, but it is necessary to inquire seriously into the substance of this episode. If the schooner was carrying arms, where are the arms? If the schooner was the vanguard of a fleet, where are the other units of the fleet? A quantity of contraband heroin can be h
idden in a few suitcases, as was done recently by a Guatemalan diplomat and as was discovered in this city, but a shipment of contraband arms cannot be so easily concealed. As for the fleet, we must suppose that it was swallowed up by the Caribbean, in a spirit of righteous indignation.182.	But it is now no longer a question of the 2,000 soldiers being trained in Camaguey, nor of the schooner and the invasion fleet; now Mr. Coronado Lira tells us of the existence in the Sierra Maestra and the Sierra del Escambray of jet aircraft, manufactured behind the iron curtain and manned by Chinese airmen and Cubans trained by them, of light and heavy tanks and thousands of weapons just received from the USSR, to be used in a war of aggression in the mountains. Is there no limit to the feverish Guatemalan imagination? The Guatemalan representative is not obliged to know our geography, as he . claimed that Mr. Roa should know the geography of his country; but if he did know the geography of Cuba, he would not choose o
ur mountain regions as bases for jet aircraft,183.	It is obvious that all this reflects a state of fear and a fully worked out plan. The present Government of Guatemala, made to the measure of the United States State Department and for its use and convenience. is reduced to the wretched role of a tool of United States policy. Guatemala is afraid, but that is not all. The Guatemalan manoeuvre is a smokescreen to cover the intention of attacking the Revolutionary Government of Cuba. The ridiculous Guatemalan accusations against our Government are meant to serve as a bridge for the State Department in an attempt to crush the Cuban Revolution. That intention was denounced by Mr. Roa in his reply on 7 October, which I now confirm in full. It is said that there will be an attack from Cuba, because what is really being planned is an attack on Cuba. The expedition which landed near Baracoa and was destroyed a few days ago and the counter-revolutionary force which was defeated in the region of Escambray confirm our
assertion. But the attempts will not stop there, as future events will show. Cuba will be not the attacker, but the attacked. We are well aware of that, but unlike Guatemala, we do not lose any sleep over it. We calmly await the enemies within and without who intend to destroy us, secure in the knowledge that we shall triumph.184.	Mr. Coronado Lira is pained that we are always talking about the case of Guatemala. We refer to the overthrow of the democratic government of Jacobo Arbenz in 1954 by the express will, not of the Guatemalan people, but of the United States State Department. These were his words: "We Guatemalans are tired of hearing so much talk about the case of Guatemala, by which it is meant that cur country was a victim of aggression on the part of an inter-continental Power" [897th meeting, para. 188]. On that point, I humbly confess, I can do nothing for Mr. Coronado Lira and those Guatemalans who think as he does. Whether they like it nor not, they will have to hear the case of Guatemala m
entioned, because that case is already part of the history of Latin America. It is not a matter which will be judged by history, but on which history has already pronounced its final verdict,185.	Shall I recall Guillermo Toriello's powerful book La Batalla de Guatemala and trace in its indignant pages, filled with facts and reasoning, the story of the intervention of the United Fruit Company and the United States State Department in the fate of democracy in that sister country; the master plan for crushing a revolution which had dared, like the Cuban revolution, to carry out an agrarian reform and to clash with United States monopolies; the diplomatic manoeuvres of United States, imperialism, culminating, at the Tenth Inter-American Conference, in the approval of resolution 93, which, under the pretext of safeguarding the American continent from the intervention of international communism, in fact represented a return to the policy of the big stick on the part of the United States State Department, and was
a dangerous manifestation of collective interventionism; the charges made in the Security Council and the non-compliance with Article 53 of the United Nations Charter; and lastly, the armed invasion, prepared and directed by the United States State Department, the treachery of the Guatemalan army officers and the direct participation of Mr. Peurifoy, the Ambassador of the United States, who was seen in battle dress with a .45 revolver under his arm, more actively engaged than Colonel Castillo Armas himself?186.	That history cannot be wiped out, and like it or not, the present delegation of Guatemala must continue to hear it told. What is most annoying to the Ydfgoras Government is the fact that the Revolutionary Government of Cuba has given asylum to Jacobo Arbenz, the deposed President of Guatemala, But did not Uruguay first offer him such asylum? Such hospitality is not contrary to, nor does it weaken, Cuba's adherence to the principle of non intervention. That is clear, positive and final. How is it po
ssible for our Government to participate in expeditionary plans, or in interference in other countries, at the very time when intervention in our own country is tragically imminent? Revolutions, we repeat, are not for export. Their moral repercussions, their example, are another matter—the example of a generation which grew beards in sign of responsibility in beardless times of conformity and petty interests. It is that example which, from the Sierra Maestra, is bound to shake the mighty Andes.187.	I shall not refer to the Guatemala of Mr. Ydfgoras, because I do not wish to be called to order, and rightly, by the Chair. I feel, however, that the Chair—and I mean Mr. Boland—was extremely indulgent at the meeting on 10 October last towards the Guatemalan representative, who was called to order only after spending thirty minutes meddling in the affairs of our country. We also, of course, could have much to say about current Guatemalan affairs, but we shall not commit the very fault which we are condemni
ng.188.	The Castro regime has no need to defend or justify itself in the face of the false and ridiculous allegations of the representative of Guatemala. But to contend cynically that the Castro Government originated from a lucky military operation and is maintainedby bayonets is to strain the limits of our patience and good humour. The Castro Government is the product of a revolutionary movement which has succeeded and could only have succeeded because it could rely on the absolute support of the people. lt was said that no insurrectionary movement could prevail against a professional army, but Castro destroyed that myth because he had the support of the people. It was also said that no Latin American Government could exist which opposed the designs and dictates of the United States Government; Fidel Castro is destroying that myth also. All this is possible because Fidel Castro has the people behind him. How can it be said that a government which is transforming barracks into schools is maintained by bay
onets? Its essentially democratic nature is confirmed by its frequent consultations of the people. Never before has the Cuban people participated so directly in the decisions of the Government. It is no longer an indifferent spectator, but an enthusiastic actor. To the terms of the Declaration of Havana and to Lincoln's definition of democracy—government of the people, by the people and for the people—nothing remains to be added. For a better understanding of the present revolutionary process in Cuba we must make a retrospective analysis, in as short a form as possible, and give a panorama of the international political situation in our country during the past century.189.	From the beginning of the nineteenth century when the first separatist movement appeared, Cuba was a victim of the ambitions of the United States, Britain and France. The European designs for a time frustrated the plans of the United States, which then preferred to maintain the status quo of a Spanish Cuba. From 1809 for almost a cen
tury, Cubans struggled by means of plots, rebellions and wars. It eventually became the policy of the United States to obtain Cuba by purchase or annexation. While the other Spanish colonies in America were becoming independent, our independence was delayed as a consequence of foreign ambitions which prevented Cuba from achieving its destiny. Pro-slavery interests and empty hopes of palliative reforms by the absolutist Spanish colonial regime also retarded our independence movement. The Cubans finally came to their great wars of independence, those of 1868-1878 and 1895-1898. When the first war, the so-called ten years war, ended, as our Enrique Jose Varona observes, "the Cuban had lost economic supremacy and had not attained political power. It is true that this phrase refers especially to the slave-holding land-owners, but it admirably expresses the fundamental difference between the revolutions of 1868 and 1895. In 1895, the Cubans were fighting to obtain political independence, but they had already lost
economic control. The revolution preached and directed by Jose Marti came from the masses, from the humble people, and its main resources were the modest contributions of the Cuban tobacco growers of Tampa and Key West, and of the lower classes, rather than the Cuban aristocracy, which had been for the most part ruined by the previous war.190.	But the will of the Cuban people to win its independence was indomitable. Although the first war of independence ended in the treaty of Zanj6n, which was nothing more, and could be nothing more, than a truce between Cuba and Spain, the great General Antonio Maceo reaffirmed in the Mangos de Baragus. protest that between Cuba and Spain there could be no conciliation or compromise, but only one answer, national independence. During that period there was no change in the trend of United States policy towards Cuba. The United States still preferred a North American Cuba and failing that, a Spanish Cuba, but never a European Cuba, having earlier, for its own purposes and
convenience, produced the so-called Monroe Doctrine, which, by the way, had been proposed in August 1823 by Lord Canning, the British Prime Minister. The Monroe Doctrine is a unilateral declaration establishing a form of protectionism which encroaches on the sovereignty of the Latin American Republics, which have never given their consent to it, and it is today without effect and serves no purpose.191.	When victory for the Cuban forces in the last war of independence was already in sight, the Government of the United States, which no longer saw the possibility of purchase or annexation, took advantage of the controversial incident of the sinking of the "Maine" to obtain from Congress the joint resolution of 19 April 1898, to proclaim that Cuba was, and by right should be, free and independent, and to intervene in the war between Cuba and Spain. The Cuban people has always recognized the generous sentiments of the people of the United States, which must not be corn- fused with the intentions and aims of th
eir Government. But that is one thing, and It would be quite a different thing to concede that one of the peoples which have fought hardest for independence owes its independence entirely to the assistance of a. third party. What is unacceptable to Cuban sentiment is that the noble purposes proclaimed in the joint resolution were followed by the refusal to allow the Cuban troops of General Calixto Garcia to make a victorious entry into Santiago de Cuba or to give Cuba a place at the Paris Conference where the treaty of peace with Spain was discussed, and, above all, by the imposition of the Platt amendment, which limited our independence.192.	This entire historical process sheds much light on what Cuba is today. We attained political independence on obviously limited terms. Since we did not have economic power, we ceased to be a colony of Spain only to become a colony of the United States. Until the time of the revolution against the tyranny of Machado, apart from a few prophetic voices of illustrious comp
atriots, the atmosphere we lived in was one of corruption and intrigue. The revolutionary struggle against that tyranny started us on the road to our goals. We had to obtain control of the economy to win full enjoyment of political independence, to attain historical independence in the fullest sense. Many of these ideas and aspirations were incorporated in the Constitution of 1940, but many were left unfulfilled. In fact, more was promised than given. The new generation—the generation of Moncada—was faced not only with the task of overthrowing the tyranny of Batista—that was the easiest task, in spite of its heroic dimensions—but also with that of changing historical reality, and of transforming a colony into a republic. To complete that historic undertaking, to make the leap over half a century of almost sterile republican existence, is the purpose of the revolutionary operation which is now being carried out.193.	That operation was described to this Assembly by our Prime Minister, Fidel Castro [8
72ndmeeting],in his powerful and comprehensive statement. We believe that we are now in the truly revolutionary phase, in which one historical reality is replaced by another, Our revolutionary process has deep democratic and nationalistic roots. We support socialization and State intervention as methods of erecting a new structure on the old social and economic forms. But we are acting independently. We are not taking shelter behind foreign ideologies or foreign flags. We are our own men. For the first time, we are moving in our own orbit. Those who slander us and misrepresent our revolutionary process are concerned only with their own interests which are affected. But there is no true revolutionary process which does not affect some interests; that is the price which must be paid to achieve the transition from one historical reality to another. The spokesmen of the United States monopolies concerned and their lackeys on the Continent, as well as those Cubans whose interests have also been affected, resort
to the worn-out expedient of trying to present us as communists. To those who speak thus, we reaffirm our independence in all spheres. Those who abuse us may be sure of one thing: we have escaped from the orbit of the United States, and we are not going to be drawn into the orbit of any other Power.194.	Without meddling in the problems of the Guatemala of Ydfgoras, I have reaffirmed, in reply to the false accusations of the Guatemalan representative, the Cuba of Fidel Castro. That is the positive fact with which we are concerned. Attempts have been made to isolate us politically, and they have not succeeded.. Attempts have been made to defeat us through hunger, and they have failed.195.	How can anyone claim that there is intervention by an extra-continental Power when the only real intervention and the only actual aggression come from a continental Power? Do they believe that Latin America is blind? We are not going to allow the corpse of the Monroe Doctrine to stand in our way. We are, first and foremos
t, men of America. But we live today in a period of close interdependence, of physical, political and moral chain reactions, and neither nations nor continents can remain isolated, because international problems and frictions, when ever they arise, affect us all.196.	Can anyone be unaware of the economic aggression which is expressly condemned by article 16 of the Charter of the Organization of American States? I think it would be appropriate to recall the text of that article: "No State may use or encourage the use of coercive measures of an economic or political character in order to force the sovereign will of another State and obtain from it advantages of any kind." Now what is the reduction of the quota of sugar which the United States had contracted to purchase from us but a typical act of economic aggression, a blow to our most important economic product? Or the ban on the export of United States products to Cuba, which is announced today on the front page of The New York Times, what is it, if not a
blatant return to the policy of economic aggression pursued by the colossus of the North to deflect our will and our determination, which nothing can deflect?197.	Cuba's case is laid before the conscience of America and the world. Our faith as Americans is not weakened by the cunning manoeuvres of some Governments, nor by the injustices and unfair blows which we may suffer. There are some who persist in their refusal to see that the day of the peoples has dawned. "We the peoples of the United Nations", proclaims our Charter. The aspirations of the peoples will one day become those of Governments.198.	The name of Jose Marti— we care not for the irreverence of the Guatemalan representative's on our lips and in our hearts. We have modelled ourselves on his words and his example. We know what our national hero thought of the expansion of United States imperialism, which he knew well, because, as he said in his immortal letter to Manuel Mercado, "I lived in the monster and I know its entrails; and David's s
ling is mine". Marti's thinking permeates the Cuban revolution from its inception to its present manifestations. We proclaim this by stating that for the first time in our history we have a Government which is honouring Jose Marti by its every action.200.	Mr. THAPA (Nepal): I am sorry to intervene at this late hour, but I assure the Assembly that I shall not take more than two minutes.201.	Since Mr. Khrushchev, in his earlier statement, expressed doubt whether we had a parliament in Nepal I have asked to be allowed to speak merely in order to dispel his doubt. I am a member of Parliament myself, so that I think that I am in a position to tell the Assembly that we have a Parliament in Nepal which is elected on the basis of universal adult suffrage. More than one political party is represented there. We have free discussions, and there are four communist members in our House of 109. We follow rules of procedure which apply equally to all members.202.	We were really surprised at what has been going on in th
is world Assembly for the past two days. We are sorry if we have offended the distinguished Chairman of the Soviet delegation by freely expressing our genuine feeling at what we witnessed. We are a small country and we have no intention of teaching a lesson to anyone. But we have our own conscience and we feel that we are entitled to express what we feel in our judgement freely in this Assembly.
Mr. AMMOUN (Lebanon) (translated from I French): I should not have attached the slightest importance to the statement made at the 897th meeting I by the delegation of Israel—a statement which constitutes a link in the chain of propaganda—I shall not use the term propaganda of hate, as did Mrs. Golda Meir,but propaganda worthy of Goebbels, which is being carried on by the Government of Israel—I should not, I say, have attached the slightest importance to it had it not contained allegations which outrage historical truth and formulated proposals which shed a false light on the situation in the Middle East, for a purpose of which we are well aware and against which we ; must warn this Assembly, in the interests of peace in the Middle East and the rest of the world.151.	Furthermore, how could I refrain from replying to an ignoble attack on an absent and far-away people —the Palestinian people—who are a people like all| those represented here, but who are vilified by every means, whose very right to
exist is denied, who are tormented and treacherously stabbed in the back when they are unable to defend themselves against such attacks or to silence calumny.152.	It is therefore in their name, as well as in that of Lebanon, that I shall speak.153.	It was with no little surprise that we heard the double invitation to disarmament and negotiation addressed to the leaders of Lebanon and the other Arab countries. From whom did this invitation come? From the representative of Israel! We, the Arab countries, the real peoples of the Middle East, have undergone four centuries of aggression and foreign domination which had no sooner been put to an end#
than it was succeeded by Zionist aggression and domination; hence no one is more strongly attached than we to the idea of disarmament, whether regional or world-wide, as a prelude to security and peace.154.	No one is more concerned with security than we are, no one is more eager for that peace based on justice to which the President of the United States recently referred [868th meeting]. Nevertheless seemingly peaceful and disinterested proposals may cause surprise when they are made by certain persons or representatives of certain Governments. When disarmament is advocated by a country which is characterized by a peaceful spirit and a policy and conduct exempt from ambition, and particularly from territorial ambition, there is no reason to doubt its sincerity and the purity of its intentions. But it is impossible not to doubt the sincerity and good faith or to suspect the motives which impel a country to request its close neighbours to disarm when it was itself bora amidst the clash of arms, when its comi
ng into being was a first violation of the just peace implied in the idea of the right of peoples to self-determination, when its birth entailed the death of another State, a crime known as genocide, while since its appearance it has never ceased to accumulate arms and to attack its neighbours, one after the other , culminating in the recent attack on the Suez Canal and on Egypt, for the purpose of carrying out its avowed policy of territorial expansion. It must be admitted that such doubts constitute a defensive reflex for which we cannot be blamed.155.	Yes, after they have overwhelmed the Holy Places with blood and fire, after they have expelled the peaceful inhabitants by the sword, after massacres which spared the lives neither of women, children nor infants, nor of the Minister of the United Kingdom in the Middle East nor the representative of the United Nations, after they have vainly attempted to justify these misdeeds, we behold a startling change: they have become the apostles of peace, the wolf h
as donned sheep’s clothing.156.	The Holy Bible, which Israel invokes to support its claims, was quoted to justify these murders and thefts. But according to the Bible, which I know and respect as you do, the Lord said: "Thou shalt not kill, thou shall not steal".157.	Mrs. Golda Meir, who is well acquainted with the Bible, considers herself also to be learned in history. She reminds us that the Jewish people were already in Palestine two thousand years ago. That is true, but the Jewish people were also in the Egypt of the Pharaohs, a mere two thousand five hundred years ago. They were with Abraham in Chaldea, now known as Iraq, some three thousand years ago* So why not annex Egypt and Iraq to Palestine, not to mention the Garden of Eden?158.	When the destruction of a State is involved, the State of Palestine, entrusted by the League of Nations to the British Government, which nevertheless handed it over to the Haganah and Irgun gangs, when a whole people is expelled from its homeland and reduced to the
status of refugees, such arguments cannot be used to justify genocide and plunder.159.	How many of you, gentlemen, represent peoples which can boast of having occupied their national soil for a thousand years? Even those who could do so might, according to the Zionist argument, be robbed of the land where their ancestors are buried, under whose skies they were born and which both law and conscience oblige them to defend sword in hand.160.	Are not the three million Jews who have been established in New York for less than a hundred years afraid that their co-religionists' argument might be turned against them? Have they more rights in this city than the Arabs who have been settled in Palestine for over a thousand years and—according to historical evidence which is at least as valid as that of Mrs. Golda Meir—were there long before Joshua invaded Palestine? For Palestine must have been inhabited before that first invasion; otherwise there would have been no walls of Jericho.161.	Therefore it was an inva
sion, and there has been another one in our day. And they dare to claim a right to Palestine 1162.	Invasion after invasion, history repeats itself. Do conquests, occupation and plunder constitute a right? This invasion, whose brutality and violence make it worthy of former times, is the sol© reason for which families, old people, women and children have gone into exile.163.	The propaganda statement that the Arab Governments incited the Palestinians to leave their homes is a gratuitous lie, intended to reinforce opposition to the repatriation of the refugees. They left their country of their own free will, we are told, let them stay where they are.164.	No, people do not leave their homes, the homes where they have lived, the homes of their forefathers, abandoning all their possessions, not knowing what may become of them, or rather knowing that those homes will fall a prey to the vandalism of a licentious soldiery, greedy for plunder and for blood. People do not leave their homes, leading their children
by the hand along perilous paths, taking with them, of all they possess, only what will enable them to live for a-few days, unless there are serious reasons that impel them to do so.165.	But what need of such reasoning? I will refer to a great person in Israel, Manahim Begin. Allow me to present him. He is the chief of the powerful Herut party, which supports the expansionist policy of an Israel including three rivers: the Jordan, the Euphrates and the Nile. Manahim Begin is the chief of Irgun. In that capacity he has a seat in parliament and enjoys the respect of his colleagues, although he admitted responsibility for the murder of Count Bernadotte. He has also claimed the credit for a number of other murders and nameless acts of violence for the purpose. He himself boasts of causing panic and making room for Jewish immigrants.166.	Does not Holy Scripture, the Word of God, say: "Out of thy mouth have I condemned thee, O Israel".167.	Since God has done so, you too can condemn them with a clear conscience
.168.	Next Mrs. Golda Meir sees fit to describe to us the pleasant lives led by the thousands of Arabs who have remained in Palestine and the 40,000 refugees, out of a total of over a million, whom, according to her, the Government of Tel-Aviv has so generously made welcome.169.	Yes, let us speak of them! The non-Jewish Palestinian, whether Christian or Moslem, who is admittedto this anachronistic theocracy is not a citizen but a prisoner, a captive. He may not travel about or leave his domicile without authorization. He cannot go from Nazareth to Tiberias, a few miles away, without a pass for which he must apply to the authorities and which Is frequently refused. He is subjected to the most odious racial segregation. Let that be remembered by our African friends, with whom we denounce racial discrimination in the Union of South Africa. The same morality should reign in Asia as in Africa.170.	The upholders of socialism, and in particular the leaders of the International Federation of Socialist Parties,
which recently met at Haifa, should know, although care was taken to hide it from their eyes, what is the situation of the Arab workers in Israel, the shameful discrimination to which they are subjected, especially in the health and social spheres, the starvation wages they earn compared with the princely wages paid to Jewish workers. In fact they are second-class citizens living in a racist and theocratic State.171.	We challenge Israel to agree to a commission of inquiry which would establish the facts before the whole world.172.	Mention has been made of seven Arab armies which were called to the rescue of the Palestinian people. Against what enemy were these forces fighting? Against the Haganah and Irgun gangs which later formed the army of Israel? Or was it not rather against an international coalition of Powers ?173.	Have we forgotten the air-lift between Europe and Palestine, the prototype of the Berlin air-lift organized in the face of Soviet power, which served for the mass transport of men and we
apons to Israel?174.	Have we forgotten the flying fortresses which left United States airfields, piloted by Jews or pro- Jews, going to join the Israel armed forces?175.	Have we forgotten that the Commander-in-Chief at Haifa was the very same man who opposed the Government of General Franco and who went to Palestine especially for the purpose of leading the action against the Arab armies of defence? After that can there be any doubt that there was a coalition, an international conspiracy?176.	When one considers that the very Powers which joined together to subjugate Palestine are those which have just voted in favour of the admission of the African States to the United Nations, one wonders whether it would not have been better for that unhappy country, Palestine, to remain under mandate until this year so as to enjoy,, together with those new States, the independence which is consecrated by admission to the United Nations and to which the League of Nations recognized its right.177.	However that may be,
the Governments of the Arab countries which were the victims of the international conspiracy have observed the truce decided upon by the Security Council. And now, for the sake of a facile platform or propaganda success, are we to be blamed for the respect we have shown towards the United Nations and its resolutions ?178.	After all that, it is suggested that we should open peace negotiations. What kind of peace? A just peace, as President Eisenhower said? Or a peace founded on an accomplished fact, sanctioning injustice and crime?179.	No, we really cannot trust the new champions of peace. How can we do so when, under sheep’s clothing, they conceal ambitions which are hard to restrain and are only waiting for the right moment, a moonless night at Qibya, to erupt into violence?180.	Their invasion of Palestine has in fact not satiated their thirst for conquest. Who is unaware of the Zionists* ambitions? If you were at the third session which was held in Paris in 1948 you will remember the insolent words o
f the man who was rewarded with the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel and who did not conceal Zionism’s ambition purely and simply to absorb the Kingdom of Jordan.181.	I will tell you, if you do not know it already, that the geography books in the Israel schools, books which children absorb for the time when they are grown up, represent the Zionist State of tomorrow as extending, allegedly according to the Prophets, from the Euphrates in the heart of Iraq to the Nile in the heart of Egypt, encompassing, of course, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. I do not know whether to laugh at that or to take it seriously. That, however, is what the young people are taught. We hear it from the mouth of Ben Gurion himself. Moreover, it is shown brazenly and blatantly on the map which decorates the hall of the Israel Parliament.182.	What is the value of the idle promises which Mrs. Golda Meir made from this rostrum, in the face of the teaching given to the rising generation, which leaves an indelible imprint on
its mind and whose evil effects even a modem Mephistopheles could scarcely erase; in the face of the words of the Prophets which are used, incorrectly it. is true, to influence the masses; in the face of the declarations of principle on official policy which are inscribed on the frontage of the Parliament building; and. in the face of the claims made by Ben Gurion, the Head of the Government?183.	I should like Mrs. Golda Meir to tell us whether she can ask her chief, Mr. Ben Gurion, to raise his hand, without fear that it will wither , and tear down the provocative map from the wall of the Knesset.184.	But if the State of Israel is willing to restrict its territorial ambitions to the Nile and the Euphrates, the same does not apply to its colonialist ambitions, which are no less dangerous to peace.185.	It may well seem surprising that a small State should have colonialist ambitions, which are normally an attribute of rich and powerful States. But this surprise vanishes as soon as it is known what more pow
erful States are hiding behind the Israel facade. That fact must be revealed for the benefit of the young countries which are not aware of it. It is not that we, a young country ourselves although a very ancient people, claim to have more experience; but we have had more experience than anyone else of the Israel problem.186.	Foreseeing the downfall of Western colonialism, Theodore Herzl requested the British Government’s support for the founding of a Jewish national home long before the 1917 Balfour Declaration. He promised that the future Jewish State would be a Western State implanted in the East, at the gates of Asia, so thatBritish and European colonialism could be assisted and developed there. Hence the Zionists rejected the suggestion made at the Zurich Congress in 1896 that a Jewish home should be founded in Argentina. Similarly they rejected the British proposal that they should be given territory in Mozambique or somewhere else is Africa. Their ambition was centred on Palestine, which was to be
come the bridgehead of colonialism in Asia, leaving them the way open to unlimited expansion.187.	Israel is today trying to put Herzl’s project into effect, not only in Asia but also and above all in Africa. While colonialism is withdrawing, bag and baggage, from those continents, an attempt is being made to replace it by a colonialism disguised under a Jewish label, backed by foreign capital.188.	It might well be asked where the Jewish Government is obtaining the large amounts of capital which it is investing in those vast continents. Who is advancing it the money, if not the Powers which are helping it to exist? Being an artificial State, it could not live without foreign assistance, particularly from the moneyed Powers, i.e. without the help of United Kingdom, United States, or German Jews, who are all more concerned about the fate of Israel than about that of the countries which have welcomed and adopted them, without direct aid from the Governments themselves, the United States and the Federal Repu
blic of Germany in particular.189.	Can a State which is thus living at the expense of the foreigner supply the States of Africa and Asia, from its own resources, with the substantial economic and technical assistance which it has undertaken to give?190.	And as we are now dealing with the problem of disarmament, I cannot fail to mention the military assistance which Israel is also supplying in the form of military missions and armaments. Can it carry out the immense task which it has undertaken unless it is the barely disguised representative of a new colonialism?191.	France and the United Kingdom have emancipated dozens of peoples and have sponsored their admission to the United Nations. We ardently wish and hope that economic and cultural co-operation, devoid of any idea of exploitation, will go on developing between those peoples and the Powers which used to administer them. That is in everyone’s interest, it is in the interest of progressive mankind.192.	Meanwhile, however, a new Zionist colonialis
m is showing its cloven hoof. The Federal Republic of Germany and the United States must be made to realize what happens to the subsidies they are lavishing on Israel. That is why there must be a unanimous vote in favour of putting an end to colonialism under whatever form and wherever it may exist, so as to establish independence and liberty in the world once and for all.193.	The anti-colonialist countries, and especially those which have suffered from colonialism, must define and unify their position with regard to colonialist Zionism.194.	We want our friends in Africa and Asia to know this, if they do not suspect it already. Mozambique at one time escaped from the Zionist grasp and we do not want the countries of Africa and Asia to succumb to it in another way, through an economic invasion and domination. Other far more powerful States have had to struggle, from the Middle Ages onwards, against the financial and economic ascendancy of a Zionism which was still lurking in the shadows and did not then, a
s it does now, possess State institutions.195.	Even here in this great country you can see Zionism influencing finance, the Press, politics and even the presidential elections.196.	Thus the reason why we do not want our friends to fall into the trap is because we know the duplicity of Zionist policy, having been subjected to it ourselves.197.	It is true that the agents of Zionist expansion now come before us in sheep’s clothing and say: We are a small State, we have not, and we cannot have, the ambitions of the Western Powers which colonized you. As for the Eastern Powers, you can see what they are doing to the peoples they dominate in Europe itself. So put your trust in us, a small State with neither the intention nor the opportunity of dominating.198.	No, we cannot trust the words of those who do not abide by what they have written and signed.199.	What have they done about the United Nations resolutions? What have they done about the Protocol of Lausanne , which they signed on the eve of Israel’s
admission to the United Nations on 12 May 1949 and which they repudiated the very next day?Itis perfectly clear that the only reason why they subscribed to the document in which they recognized the resolutions entailing the return of the refugees to their homes, the evacuation of the territories occupied in violation of those resolutions and the internationalization of Jerusalem, was to mislead the Security Council and the General Assembly and to facilitate the admission of Israel to the United Nations. As soon as Israel was admitted, they regarded the document which they had signed the previous day in the presence of the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine as a mere scrap of paper.200.	If they had respected that authentic document, they would not have claimed that the war in Palestine had nullified the United Nations resolutions. The Protocol of Lausanne, signed in 1949 immediately after the war of 1948, involved, as has been said, recognition of the United Nations resolutions. The war c
ould not invalidate resolutions which were recognized a year later. We can thus understand why Israel rejects a text which commits it to observing those resolutions.201.	There were negotiations at Lausanne. And that is all the value which was placed on those negotiations and their results, which were duly noted in the records of the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine. Is it now proposed that we should negotiate again after this breach of the respect due to treaties and to the pledged word?202.	We can only negotiate with those in whom we have confidence. They come asking for negotiations without prior conditions. Whom are they trying to deceive? This is the denial of past commitments; they are being disavowed once again. We will not be their dupes. Let them begin by respecting the Protocol of Lausanne and applying its provisions.^ See Official Records of the General Assembly. Fourth Session. Ad Hoc Political Committee. Annexes. Vol. II, document A/927, annex A.203.	Is anything further n
eeded to induce you not to regard the verbal proposal they have made today as any more sincere or honest than the signature which they affixed in the past? Let them, if they dare, declare that they will respect the United Nations resolutions and that they will abandon once and for all their ambitions of territorial expansion to the north, the south, the east, or in Jerusalem itself. Let them tear up the textbooks which bedevil and poison the young people, and not the documents which they solemnly signed with the United Nations as witness.204.	The danger to security in the Middle East does not arise so much from armaments , particularly those possessed by the Arab States; those armaments were only once used by an Arab country, Egypt, and that was in order to repel Israel’s attack on the Suez Canal in 1958. Israel's armaments, on the contrary, are offensive weapons. That was established during that same Sues campaign. Nevertheless, it is not the few tens of thousands of armed men that represent the greates
t danger, but the million unarmed Palestinians who have been expelled from their homes and deprived of all their possessions, and whose state of wretchedness and destitution is an offence against justice and humanity and, in short, a threat to peace and tranquillity.205.	Let Israel respect, the commitments it undertook with respect to the United Nations itself, particularly regarding the refugees and the property of which they were robbed, before it presumes to undertake any further commitments only to contravene them immediately afterwards.206.	Then and only then will you be entitled, if you can rid your minds of doubt and suspicion, to contemplate with a certain amount of indulgence—for a great deal is needed—the speeches delivered by the Israel representatives and the promises they make , with their hand on their hearts, from this rostrum.
208.	Mr. UMANA BERNAL (Colombia) (translated from Spanish): The Colombian delegation was on the list of speakers on the morning of 13 October so that it could comment on certain words which the Head of the Soviet delegation used [869th meeting] in referring to the statement we made at the 902nd meeting.209.	We gave up our right to speak at that time because of the new circumstances brought about by the impressive and timely speech [896th meeting] of Mr. S8kou Tour8, the President of the Republic of Guinea, and because of the healthy response it evoked.210.	We do not, however, wish to wait any longer before expressing to the General Assembly the objection of the Government and representatives of Colombia to the improper and intemperate interference of the Head of the Soviet delegation in the domestic affairs of Colombia by his remarks about our delegation and his statement that it did not properly represent the Colombian people.211.	It is certainly not for the President of the Council of Ministers of the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the sovereign pontiff of international communism, to decide who are the spokesmen of the Republic of Colombia at international conferences and organizations. 212.	The Colombian delegation was appointed by the legitimate Government of the Republic, a Government freely elected in authentic popular elections carried out under the legal and constitutional provisions which govern our system of representative democracy. We well understand that this system cannot be to the liking of those who believe in totalitarian dictatorship, either of the left or of the right, but we categorically reject the inadmissible claim of the Head of the Soviet delegation to speak on behalf of the Colombian people and we see in his attitude yet another proof of the determination of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to interfere improperly in the domestic affairs of Latin American countries.213.	There was also, in connexion with our attitude in that debate, a reference to the Monroe Doctrine.
On behalf of my delegation and Government, I must repeat what the Colombian Minister for Foreign Affairs said at the 880th meeting in the general debate: the famous Monroe Doctrine has been superseded by the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance of Rio de Janeiro signed in September 1947 and by other international instruments freely agreed upon by the countries belonging to the Organization of American States,214.	This is not the moment to deal with the question of colonialism} we shall have occasion to put our strongly anti-colonialist views in connexion with the speeches and resolutions on the subject that will be submitted to the Assembly. For the time being we shall confine ourselves to expressing the fervent hope that the solemn character which this debate is expected to assume as a result of its being held in plenary session will not be vitiated by such lamentable scenes as the one we were astonished to witness on Wednesday evening.216.	Mr. COOPER (Liberia): The South African representativ
e, Mr. Louw has accused my country of the crime of discrimination, especially as regards ownership of property and the right to vote. We do not deny these charges; we do not deny that there are discriminatory laws in Liberia—we admit this. But we have to say this, that without such laws there would have been no Liberia today, and especially at that time when the continent of Africa was being parcelled out among the great ruling powers of our day.217.	Let us look at the record of those colonial powers. Many of the countries in Africa lost their independence by treaties forced upon them which gave the colonialists the right to purchase property. By so doing, these very same colonialists exploited these rights under the guise of protecting the rights and interests of their own people. When the aborigines resisted they were subdued by force of arms, and the possessed became the dispossessed. I think the Boers in South Africa were the victims of such a policy, which led to the South African War.218.	We have
been criticized, since our existence as a state, of wholesale exploitation and even forced labour. No state is perfect—what State does not have a skeleton in its cupboard? However, when such charges have been made against my country we have immediately investigated these charges and taken measures to remedy such evils, not unmindful thatmost of these accusations were levelled against us out of prejudice, for the sole purpose of proving that the African, and particularly the black African, was incapable of self-government and independence.219.	On our own initiative, in 1932, we invited an international commission to investigate the charges of forced labour in Liberia. I would like to know what State in the United Nations would expose its country to an investigation by an international commission when it knew in advance that such a commission would be biased and prejudiced. We did this, and we accepted the findings and recommendations, which without reservation we promptly carried out.’220.	The irony o
f the whole situation is that one of the principal accusers of forced labour resorted to this practice as soon as we abandoned.it. Would the South African Government welcome an international body to investigate the charges laid against that Government of racial discrimination and the wholesale shooting of helpless civilians at Sharpeville for the simple reason that they were black? The South African representative claims that South Africa is an African State. This we flatly deny. South Africa is a European state in Africa—for what African state would compel its citizens, especially in time of peace, to carry an identification card showing their origin and their race, while on the other hand those who had come to Africa were not required to have such identification?221.	The South African representative has contended that when the Boers landed in South Africa the country was unpopulated except for a few Hottentots and bush- men. The representative of South Africa does not regard them as being of the human
race, but as merely beasts of burden.222.	He contends, further, that the Zulus, the original inhabitants of the {greater portion of South Africa, migrated to this part of the continent of Africa; but he seems to forget that the Zulus were Africans and did not come from overseas to exploit and oppress their fellow Africans. In Liberia, owing to our unification policy, there is no discrimination and in every walk of public life and government our citizens are appointed as judges of the courts, elected members of the cabinet and members of the legislature. All our citizens, whether they came there or whether they were born there, have the same rights.223.	The habit of classifying our citizens into various groups is not of our making; it was something that was done only by the colonialists. Can the South African Government cite one single example where a native African has been allowed to hold or occupy any position of importance in South Africa? They are not even allowed to vote. And the mockery of the whole
business is that in the South African Parliament they are represented by white South Africans, not appointed by the people whom they represent, but by the Government which suppresses them.224.	Only recently we read of the plebiscite in South Africa to determine whether that country was to remain in the Commonwealth of Nations or become a Republic. In a country of ten million people, of whom only two million are white, only those of white origin were allowed to decide the fate of the eight million blacks.225.	As we have heretofore said, every country has some black pages in its record, but never have I seen a country that tries to justify discrimination, exploitation and even massacre such as South Africa. How does the South African Government justify its right to exploit, suppress and even MU its fellow men? They base this on the Charter of the United Nations and say: Why allow interference in the domestic jurisdiction of South Africa? According to their view, they have the right to exploit, oppress or e
ven massacre the eight million blacks in South Africa— they say it is nobody’s business but their own.226. Let the South African Government take warning that the people of Africa will not continue to permit their fellow Africans to be the victims of such pernicious practices without taking forceful measures for the protection of the rights of their fellow Africans.
14.	Mr,. NASIR (Jordan): Let me, first of all, apologize for having to impose upon the Assembly yet another intervention in reply to some of the statements relating to the Palestine problem which were made here by the representative of Israel, Mrs. Golda Meir.15.	The Palestine problem was born and continues to survive and flourish behind a thick smoke-screen of very clever and devious distortions and misrepresentations. Even the imperialistic Powers which played the decisive role in creating the problem had always to extend on distortions for argument and support. Obviously the problem cannot be solved unless this smoke-screen is lifted so that the real facts may be clearly discerned. It is, therefore, my purpose in this intervention to correct, I hope once for all, some of the misrepresentations which were made before you here a few days ago.16.	Referring to the error in the Middle East mentioned by Arab spokesmen, Mrs. Meir asks: "Now, what is the error in the Middle East that certain Arab spokesmen des
ire to see corrected? Is an independent Jewish State in that area an accident or an innovation?" [897th meeting, para. 154.117.	The answer to this question is both simple and clear. The creation of a Jewish State in the Middle East was nothing but a camouflaged imperialistic aggression. Hence it was an error, for is it not an errorto uproot a people out of land and homes which they and their ancestors had been living in for centuries in order to establish therein, for invaders from all over the globe, a Jewish State, on the frivolous pretext that Jews had lived there for a very short period over 2,000 years ago? This is the error which Zionists and their supporters and fellow-travellers do not seem able to recognize or willing to admit. It is of course much more than an error. It is a grave injustice inflicted upon the innocent and peace-loving Arabs of Palestine who, as well as all other Arabs, have never in their history taken part in racial discrimination against the Jews or in their persecution or in
their humiliation—matters so bitterly complained of by Mrs. Meir in her speech: "Massacres, hate, humiliation, discrimination—that was our lot." [Ibid.] No atrocities were ever perpetrated on Jews by Arabs, but these Nazi-like acts have all been inflicted on Arabs by Jews as part of the injustice which we complain of, and to which I have referred.18.	For the benefit of Members who joined the United Nations this year, permit me to describe very briefly the nature and extent of this injustice. Immediately after the First World War, the policy adopted under the British Mandate in Arab Palestine aimed at establishing in the country a Jewish State, disguised in its initial stages under the meaningless name of a "national home for the Jewish people". That this was contrary to the promises given by the victorious Allies to their Arab comrades in arms is a matter on which1	need not dwell. It was in any case contrary to the fundamental human rights and to the wishes of the inhabitants of Palestine who consiste
d at that time of 650,000 Arabs, Moslems and Christians, and approximately 56,000 Jews, most of them Arab Jews. The percentage was thus 92 per cent Arabs and 8 per cent Jews. The Jews were then the owners of about2	per cent of the total area of the country.19.	When the resolution to partition Palestine was adopted by the United Nations in 1947, the Jewish population had risen, mainly through immigration, which was forced on the Arabs, to about 650,000, while the Arab population had increased by natural growth to about 1,350,000. Thus at the time of the resolution the Arabs constituted more than two-thirds of the population, while the Jews constituted only less than one-third. Jewish land ownership hadby then increased to 5 1/2 per cent of the total^area. Regardless of these facts, however, the partition resolution gave the Jewish State more than 56 per cent of the total area, that is to say, more than ten times what the Jews owned in land property, whereas the Arab State was only given less than 44 per ce
nt.20.	The figures speak for themselves, and no special intelligence is. needed to realize the glaring injustice of partition, which was adopted by. the United Nations in spite of the vehement protests of the Palestine Arabs, supported by all Arabs and by many other nations as well.. The political pressures which were then used to secure the adoption of the resolution are well known.21.	No sane human being could therefore have accepted such an unjust resolution; and when the Arabs of Palestine resisted it, the Jews felt entitled to aggravate the injustice by taking more of the Arab properties. The result of it all was that the Jews occupied about four-fifths of the country, and one million innocent Arabs were expelled from their homes and their country and became refugees.22.	Compare this situation with the initial conditions in 1917, when the Jews constituted 8 per cent of the population and owned 2 per cent of the land. Such is the injustice which has been inflicted upon the Arabs of Palestine by force
of arms, and such is the error which Zionists and their supporters refuse to admit.23.	But this is only the physical aspect of the injustice. To it must be added the psychological effects of the loss of security and dignity, of the demoralization caused by ever-increasing unemployment, of the bitterness engendered in the hearts of innocent people because they were punished for the crimes committed against Jews by others in non-Arab lands.24.	Let me mention at this point that before and during the First World War, and before the British mandate over Palestine, Arabs lived very happily with the Jews. They all spoke Arabic, and in fact they were considered for all purposes as Arabs. After all, we are brothers in humanity, and furthermore we both belong to the same Semitic race. Great sympathy was always shown towards Jews who were persecuted in other parts of the world, and whenever some of them came to Palestine, or to other Arab areas, they were given asylum, and were received with generous welcome and go
odwill. Even as late as the Second World War, when the present ruler of Arab Morocco, which had then fallen under Nazi influence and domination, was asked to isolate Jews he very nobly and emphatically refused to do so, answering that all Moroccan citizens must continue to be treated alike. In spite of such a magnanimous attitude and treatment however, Zionists, by false and persistent propaganda, eventually succeeded in deceiving many Jews and in persuading them to leave their places of birth, their real national homes, and go to Israel. We feel that these Jews may have already regretted their action.25.	It is these happy relations which always existed between Arabs and Jews that make the Jewish aggression on Arab Palestine a painful example of ingratitude and a sad tragedy in human relations. One is therefore bound to reflect: was the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine a good thing for the world, and was it worth so much sacrifice in international peace and goodwill?26.	Perhaps the saddest asp
ect of the tragedy, however, is that this very elementary but grave act of aggression and injustice is not recognized as such by an intelligent group of people like the Jews, who have good reason to be proud of their history, of their Bible, and of their ethics. Hence they ask the question: "What is the error?" This blindness to error and injustice is the root of the whole problem of Palestine. As long as such an attitude is maintained, as long as "wrong" is called "right", and as long as the rights and welfare of a million human beings are sacrificed for the political ends of others, no solution will be found to the Palestine problem, and no real peace can consequently be established in the Middle East.27.	But Zionists are not satisfied with lack of recognition of aggression. On the contrary, they go further and claim that the Arabs were themselves the aggressors In Palestine. I quote from Mrs. Meir’s statement: "The Arab aggression in Palestine against Israel and the United Nations is the one and only
reason for the existence of the Arab refugee problem."  [897th meeting, para. 162.] How untrue and sanctimonious this statement is. The real truth is that if Jews had not coveted Palestine, if they had not come to it against the wishes of its inhabitants under the protection of foreign bayonets, as stooges of imperialism, there would have been no refugee problem in Palestine at all.28.	But are we really justified in linking Israel with imperialism? Let us examine the facts very briefly. First, Jews came into Palestine, after the First World War, under the protection of British military forces; secondly, the main argument which Zionist leaders used to convince the British Government to support actively the establishment of a Zionist State in Arab Palestine was that such a State could be used as a base for protecting the route to the Far East, an important artery in British communications. This became abundantly clear during the tripartite aggression on Egypt, in which the British, the French and Israel took
part. The role played by Israel then was the one which had been set for it even before it had been born. Thirdly, Israel is not a self-supporting country, and lives mainly on alms and charity. At the same time Israel goes about lending huge sums of money to certain under-developed countries. Where does this money come from? Why is Israel chosen as an intermediary between those who provide the capital and those who need it? Can we not discern the hand of imperialism in disguise? Let those to whom Israel makes such offers be exceedingly careful, the more so when the offers appear to be generous.29.	In view of all this, I feel it a duty to implore the new States which have just joined the United Nations to examine this serious problem carefully before they lend moral support to one side or the other. It appears absurd that anyone who has just gained victory over injustice, and has become free as a result of it, should support imperialistic injustice anywhere in the world.30.	I will now proceed to other poin
ts made by Mrs. Meir. Referring to the Arab refugees she asks: "Why are they not absorbed as we absorbed our refugees; as we housed and employed the 240,000 Arabs that are in Israel today...?" [Ibid., para. 158.]31.	Could anything more misleading be said regarding the Arabs in Israel? Hearing the claims of Mrs. Meir one would imagine that Israel has been so generous and gracious as to house and give employment to these Arabs. The Arabs who are now in Israel are a section of the real owners of the country. They own lands, houses and other properties, most of which have been usurped to give housing and employment to Jewish immigrants from abroad. Thus the Arabs in Israel do not live because of the generosity and gracious ness of Israel, but they live in spite of the persecution and ill-treatment which they receive at the hand of Israel. It may be of interest to this Assembly to be informed of some of the forms taken by that ill-treatment and persecution: first, expropriation of property in order to make room
for additional Jewish immigrants; secondly, restriction of movement for the Arab individual; thirdly, compulsory sale to the Government of Arab crops at prices lower than those paid to Jewish cultivators; fourthly, enactment of nationality and land laws which deny the Arab citizen the same rights and privileges enjoyed by the Jewish citizen; fifthly, collection of taxes on land which the Arab community is not permitted to cultivate; and sixthly, terrorization of the Arabs by army raids and searches under false pretexts.32.	I do not wish to labour these points, but I suggest that an impartial commission of inquiry be appointed to examine the conditions under which Arabs in Israel are living. K is important for the world to know the real facts.33.	Another point made by Mrs. Meir refers to the 500,000 Jews who came during the last twelve years from Iraq, Yemen, Egypt, Syria and other Arab lands. Let me first of all, express serious doubts as to the correctness of the figure. Be that as it may, however, I wo
uld like to ask: was there any genuine reason for those Jews to leave the Arab countries? As I said before,, Jews have always been well treated by Arabs. And the Jews who have not left their homes in Arab countries live happily there and continue to enjoy equal rights with all other citizens.34.	From the facts, which are well known, I consider the indirect allegations regarding the state of Jewish immigrants from Arab countries to be completely unjustified. And I do not hesitate, therefore, to suggest that the commission to which I referred a minute ago should compare the conditions under which Jews live in Arab countries with those under which Arabs live in Israel.35.	I will now turn to the remarks concerning the seven Arab armies and the unpreparedness of the Jewish forces. I quote Mrs. Meir: "We had to meet the invading armies virtually unarmed ..." [Ibid., para. 155.] Now the Jews won the war; we are therefore forced to conclude either that this statement is untrue or that a miracle must have happened
which enabled a virtually unarmed group of people to defeat seven armies. I have here before me the text of a British Command Paper, No. 6873, of July 1946, about twenty months before the happenings under discussion. It gives what it calls conservative figures relating to the three Jewish illegal para-military organizations in Palestine—the Haganah, the Palmach and the Irgun Zvai Leumi. According to this statement, ^these organizations had under their command 67,000 well- armed persons. We can therefore rest assured that the statement made by Mrs. Meir in this respect does not correspond with the facts, and that a miracle did not, therefore, happen.36.	I come now to the claim which is always made by Israel, and which was mentioned by Mrs. Meir, to the effect that the Arabs left their homes voluntarily at the request of their leaders: "And then came the call by the Arab leaders to the Arab population in Israel to leave immediately ... " [Ibid., para 156.] In order to explain to you the real reason why th
e Arabs left the country, I can do no better than quote the following passage from the book A Soldier with the Arabs by the British General John Bagot Glubb:"In December 1947, a senior British officer in the Arab Legion was one day visiting a British, district commissioner in Palestine. A Jewish district officer employed under the district commissioner was also present. They were having drinks in the evening. The UNO partition plan had recently been published. The British officer asked the Jewish official whether the new Jewish State would not have many internal troubles, in view of the fact that the Arab inhabitants of the Jewish State would be equal in number to the Jews. 'Oh, no." replied the Jewish officer. 'Thatwill be fixed. A few calculated massacres will soon get rid of them."" VThe calculated massacres were carried out, and the Arabs fled their homes.37.	Let us now turn our attention to another one of those classical but fantastic Israeli claims which found its way into Mrs. Meir's statement: "
And did the desert in Israel bloom as long as we were in exile? Did trees cover the Judean hills, were marshes drained? No—rocks, desert, marshes, malaria, trachoma—this is what characterized the country before we came back." [897th meeting, para. 154.] This is not the first time that we hear such wild claims. The tone even suggests that the desert did bloom 2,000 years ago when they were there, and stopped blooming only during the period of Jewish exile. How absurd! Here are the plain facts for any one who. cares to verify them. Palestine was known as the land of milk and honey long before the Jews had any contact with it, and when the Jews first arrived there, they were astounded at the, large-sized bunches of grapes which the country produced. All this we learn from the Jewish Bible.38.	However, let us look into relatively recent history. Before the First World War, Palestinian Arabs lived mainly on the produce of their land—wheat, legumes, vegetables, olives, oranges, grapes and other fruits. The
well-known Jaffa oranges are Arab oranges, not Jewish. The people worked hard for their living, but they were happy. You never heard of Palestinian Arabs going about asking for charity. The country was being developed gradually by its own inhabitants for their own benefit as fast as development was needed. The so-called Judaean hills—and I come from them- were covered with fruit trees, mainly olives and grapes, which were all planted by Arabs. Certain areas had not yet been developed. This was only natural. Such was the situation at the end of the First World War, and not as the Israelis would have you believe.39.	Immediately after the war, Jewish immigrants began to come in, against the wishes of the Arabs, in accordance with the "Jewish national home" policy to which I have already referred. Naturally, with more people and more money it was possible to develop the country faster. But what was the result? The country stopped being self-supporting .and has not been so since. Huge sums of money have been
poured into Israel every year, and huge sums will have to continue to be poured in, simply because the whole operation is uneconomic and unnatural. It needs artificial feeding and artificial breathing as well.40.	Regarding the trachoma aspect of the Israeli claiixi, one cannot but be surprised indeed. Palestine had an eye clinic and hospital, established, maintained and run by the British Order of St. John, long before the Jews came in. No words of praise are sufficient for the work which this organization has been doing in Palestine. It gives its services to all persons fre8 of charge. That the Jews should claim credit for such noble work of a very old and noble organization is more than surprising.41.	Let us, however, ask what is behind all these false claims of Israel relating to development. Do they seriously mean to convince us and the world that in order to develop Palestine there was no alternative but to create a Jewish State there, attended by cruel massacres, by the continuous suffering of a mi
llion people, by racial hatred, and by the loss of international peace and goodwill? Is it not like burning a house in order to find a penny? Or, conversely, do they mean to tell us that the object of the Jews in creating their State was to develop Palestine? As a child who studied the Bible, I was always taught that the Jews had a unique and noble role in history, to produce prophets and ethical principles. Is it not a great pity that they should now come down to the level of feeling proud and praiseworthy of their success in producing potatoes instead? What a decline in ideals, and a waste of ability and intelligence!42.	I would like now to refer to one final point, namely, the call by Mrs. Meir to negotiate for peace: "Ever since the Arab aggression against Israel in 1948 we have called on our neighbours to negotiate in order to settle all problems at issue between us and to conclude a peace. So far they have refused to do so ..." [Ibid., para. 164.] I regret to say that this statement is not true, hi 1
949, Arab and Israel delegates went to Lausanne. A certain agreement was reached and was signed by the parties concerned on 12 May 1949. This was the well-known Protocol of Lausanne. The following day, however, the Israel delegates withdrew their signatures. It was discovered later that in Lausanne they had been merely manoeuvering for admission to the United Nations. Everyone will undoubtedly realize the permanent psychological effect which such trickery must have had.43.	Let me emphatically repeat what I said before, that unless there is a change in attitude, unless a wrong is called a wrong and unless there is open recognition of the aggression and the injustice, and unless there is undoubted willingness to remove the injustice inflicted on Palestine Arabs, there can be no hope of solving the Palestine problem or of establishing real peace in the Middle East.44.	One of the most perturbing factors of the Palestine problem is the continuous extension of aggression on Arab rights which is being carried ou
t mainly in three ways. The first is continuing Jewish immigration into Israel, in spite of the fact that Israel is not self- supporting. This additional Jewish immigration is used as a pretext to block the return of Arab refugees to their properties and their homes, thus rendering the solution of the problem more difficult. The second is the expropriation of the properties of the Arabs, even those who are in Israel, as I mentioned before. The third is the plans and efforts to divert part of the waters of the Jordan river for the benefit of immigrants. My country, the Kingdom of Jordan, is badly in need of every drop of water in the Jordan River for its present and future inhabitants. Although these waters are not fully utilized at present, because of lack of funds, our very existence demands that they be fully used for our benefit in the future. We depend mainly on rain water, and for the last few years, our people have been short even of drinking water. Is it reasonable for us, therefore, to allow even a
part of the waters of the River Jordan to be diverted for the benefit of newly arrived foreigners and strangers while our sons and daughters go thirsty for lack of water? This additional aggression will eventually exhaust the patience of the most peaceful human beings.45.	In conclusion, I feel it is a duty to call upon all sincere Jewish leaders of the world, not only those of Israel, and on all other world leaders as well to study the facts of the Palestine problem deeply and solemnly, realizing the great responsibility that falls upon them to co-operate in the recognition and removal of injustice, which is the only means of re-establishing peace in the land universally accepted as the land of peace.47.	Mr. TCHICHELLE (Congo, Brazzaville) (translated from French): I have asked for permission to return to the rostrum primarily in order to dispel any confusion that might have resulted from the course in Congolese constitutional law with which the Guinean Head of State has favoured the representatives to th
e United Nations—they, in his opinion, having been unaware of the contents of the Congolese Constitution.48.	The President of the Republic of Guinea has told us that in the preamble to the Constitution of the Republic of the Congo—I presume that he was in fact referring to the Fundamental Law of 18 May 1960 which does not, to my knowledge, begin with a preamble—the Round-Table Conference at Brussels had adopted for the Republic of the Congo (capital: Leopoldville) the system of a Chief of State who does not have responsibility.49.	In a statement made on 13 October 1960, one representative told you what he thought of the question of the responsibility of the Congolese Chief of State. With the same objectivity as my colleague, and with his consent, I would like to supplement his thesis.50.	We think that the phrase of Chief of State who does not have responsibility, occurring in a text concerned with constitutional law, should not shock us unduly, any more than the statement: "The King reigns but does
not govern." But, in consciously detaching this phrase from its constitutional context and placing it within a political context, the President of Guinea has invested the non-responsibility of the Congolese Head of State with an exclusively civil character. He states ... Thank you, Mr. President, for having allowed me to return to the rostrum in order to make an explanation with regard to the right of reply which I wished to exercise. I was the first speaker to define the position of the Government of the Republic of the Congo (Leopoldville). A speaker then came to the rostrum in order to give us what I called a moment ago a course in constitutional law, to which I merely wished to reply with a few words. I had no intention of debating a point which has occupied the attention of this Assembly for all too long. That, Mr. President, is the explanation which I am in a position to give you.59.	I should like to repeat that I was the first to give, from this rostrum, explanations regarding the constitutional na
ture—which a number of speakers from the rostrum had challenged—of the power held by Mr. Kasa-Vubu in Leopoldville. I therefore thought it my duty to take the floor again in order to reaffirm what I had clearly explained previously.60.	That was the sole purpose for which I asked, today, permission to exercise my right of reply.53.	Mr. TOURE Ismael (Guinea) (translated from French): I thank you, Mr. President, for having given me the floor and I apologize for have interrupted the gentleman who, was just speaking. I was somewhat surprised when he announced that he wished to exercise the right of reply. 54.	While President Toure did speak of the situation in the Congo, he was referring, I should point out, to the Republic of the Congo (capital: Leopoldville). If I am not mistaken, the gentleman who has just spoken represents the Republic of the Congo (capital: Brazzaville). I should like the President to tell me whether any representative whatsoever has a right to reply to statements made by a speaker r
egarding conditions in a country which is not his own.55.	I think that this point should be clarified for the purpose of the conduct of the General Assembly's subsequent discussions.
66.	Mrs. MEIR (Israel): We deeply regret that we again' have to take up some of the valuable time of this Assembly. We should, of course, have known from experience that nothing angers the representatives of the Arab States more than a call for peace. But we nevertheless promise faithfully not to give up this call until there is peace in the Middle East. We know it will come, it must come, and we are convinced that it is for the good of all concerned that it should come soon. The sooner the better.67.	We have listened to outbursts of hate quite unworthy of this forum. But realizing how untenable their position is when they refuse to answer a call for peace and negotiations, for anon-aggression agreement and for disarmament with, of course, mutual inspection and control, they have produced a series of most fantastic accusations that distort both the ancient and the modern history of our area and our people.68.	We heard a further example of this only a few moments ago when the representative of Jordan gave
us another chapter of so-called history of the Jewish people, of the aims and the task of the Jewish people as he would like to assign them. According to his words, he is evidently not opposed to the idea that the Jewish people, scattered all over the world and living everywhere as minorities—living not by right but by the grace of others who may choose to be kind to them or not to be kind to them—should bring forth prophets from their midst. But God forbid that the Jewish people—like every other people in the world, like the ten and more Arab countries who have all become independent since the First World War—that the Jewish people too should have a piece of soil under their feet in order that they may grow potatoes for their profit and for themselves. The poet laureate of the Jewish people said that the space of sky above the head of a people is only as large as the soil under its feet. Only when people are rooted in their soil— and raising potatoes is nothing to be ashamed of—only when they h
ave roots deep in their soil, only then can their culture and prophecy also flourish.69.	The representative of Saudi Arabia, for instance, spoke of Nazism; and the representative of Jordan and the representative of Lebanon mentioned Goebbels.70.	I should like to ask the following: Was Haj Amin el-Hussein, the Mufti of Jerusalem, accepted as a leader by the representative of Saudi Arabia when the Mufti went to Berlin and helped Hitler in the extermination of the Jewish people? Was the Mufti ever denounced for this by the representatives of Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Jordan? When the Mufti worked with Hitler, was photographed with him, did these Arab spokesmen not know that the Nazi racial programme divided the peoples of the world into several categories: Germans—the Herrenvolk; French, British, Scandinavians and a few other nations, to be absorbed into the Nazi Herrenvolk; Slavic peoples— some to be exterminated, the rest to be turned into slaves of the Germans; Negroes, who were not even to be conside
red human; and Jews—for them, physical extermination of every man, woman and child. These Arab representatives who now appear here as crusaders for the equality of all peoples, what did they have to say about this racial doctrine at that time, and the co-operation of the Mufti with Hitler?71.	The self-defence organization of Haganah has been mentioned. Most members of my delegation, including myself, have the distinction of having been members of this organization, and are proud of it. It was the Haganah that defended Jewish lives from Arab attacks in cities and villages in 1920, 1921, 1929, 1936 to 1939, and in 1947. We refused to be easy victims to onslaughts against Jews instigated by the same Mufti and his colleagues. Yes, we organized "self-defence—this is the literal meaning of the word Haganah. And at a later stage the Haganah played a historic part in the struggle against foreign rule in our country and its members took their full share in the war against Hitler Germany in the Middle East, Afri
ca and Europe.72.	So much has been said here, and with so much pathos, about United Nations resolutions. But what was the answer of the Arab League to the United Nations resolution of 1947? The countries belonging to the Arab League not only rejected the resolution, but they went to war to defeat it. It does no good to deny this from this rostrum when it is written in the annals of this Organization, the United Nations; in the records of the Security Council there are cables from the Arab League and the Egyptian Government officially announcing what they themselves termed "armed intervention" in Palestine by their invading armies. That was the historical "error", and it left behind it a bitter legacy, including the creation of the Arab refugee problem.73.	Who called upon the Palestine Arabs to leave? I should like to quote a few sources. In an interview given to the Lebanese paper Sada al-Janub on 16 August 1948, Mr. George Hakim, the Greek-Catholic Archbishop of Galilee, said—remember, this was 16 Aug
ust 1948:"The refugees had been confident that their absence from Palestine would not last long, that they would return within a few days—within a week or two. Their leaders had promised them that the Arab armies would crush the 'Zionist gangs' very quickly and that there was no need for panic or fear of a long exile."74.	On 6 September 1948, Emil Ghoury, the Secretary of the Arab Higher Committee, stated to a representative of the Beirut Telegraph:"At the time of the first truce the number of Arab refugees was 200,000. By the time the second truce began this number had risen to 300,000. It is impossible to foretell how many more refugees there will be if the hostilities are renewed and there is a third truce. I do not want to impugn anyone, but only to help the refugees. The fact that there are these refugees is the direct consequence of the action of the Arab States in opposing partition and the Jewish State. The Arab States agreed upon this policy unanimously, and they must share in the solution of
the problem."75.	In an article published on 19 August 1951, in Kul Shay of Beirut, the poignant question was asked:"Who brought the Palestinians to the Lebanon as refugees? Who brought them over in dire straits and without a penny? The Arab States, and the Lebanon among them. "76.	I could multiply such evidence from Arab sources to show that the responsibility for this problem must be laid squarely on the shoulders of the Arab leaders themselves.77.	It is, of course, untrue that Israel pursues expansionist policies of any kind. On the contrary, Israel calls upon the Arab States to uphold and safeguard, jointly with us, effectively and sincerely, the only policy that is justifiable under the United Nations Cnarter and in the present state of the world, namely, the policy of absolute and mutual respect for the political independence and territorial integrity of all States. For the charge of "expansionism", the representative of Lebanon produces "evidence" which seems to be taken from some spy thriller. I
refer to the fairy tales about maps and textbooks.78.	There is a large foreign diplomatic corps in Israel, whose members often visit the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, as do thousands of other foreign visitors. None of them has ever seen such a map, for one simple reason: it does not exist and never has existed.7 9. The geography textbooks to which the representative of Lebanon refers are also non-existent. We would gladly supply any delegation with a set of our school textbooks and we, in turn, invite the Arab delegations to do likewise and, if they will, we could supply some of the textbooks used in Arab countries. We have some in our possession. To our regret, such books, permeated with hate propaganda, are used even in schools supported by money from the United Nations. Not by any means do I wish to imply that those in charge of allocating this money to the schools agree with this policy, but evidently they have not the power to have other textbooks used in those schools. 80.	The allegations of the Ara
b representatives about the condition of the Israeli Arabs have been refuted on numerous previous occasions. They become no truer by repetition. The essential facts of the situation are these.81.	First, all Israeli Arabs enjoy exactly the same political rights as do the Israeli Jews. They participate fully and actively in parliamentary elections. Arab members sit in our Parliament, some belonging to the Government Coalition and others to the Opposition; and they either support or criticize the Government as they see fit.89.	Secondly, since the establishment of the State of Israel, more has been done to raise economic, social and cultural standards of our Arab community than has been accomplished in the past during centuries. Some of the most important advances concern, for example, the emancipation of Arab women, infant care, health, rural electrification, obligatory elementary schooling for both sexes, vastly increased facilities for secondary, professional and higher education, development of Arabic lan
guage and culture, improved communications for Arab villages, better housing, trade union organization of Arab workers jointly with Jewish workers and on a footing of equality and equal pay.83.	Thirdly, no Arab State can point to the achievement of a standard of living for the masses of its population that may be compared favourably to the standard of living of the Israeli Arabs. This goes for all relevant aspects and criteria, not merely for the purely economic ones, but for those indicating cultural advance and social progress as well.84.	The only outstanding difficulty concerns certain security restrictions in sensitive border areas which are rendered necessary by the belligerent policies of the neighbouring Arab States. Such restrictions have been whittled down to the bare minimum consistent with the safety and defence of our borders and will disappear entirely as soon as there are peaceful relations between the Arab States and Israel. 85.	The lectures which we have received here about Jewish history
and Zionism are so absurd and, I am sorry to say, even anti-Semitic that it is not our intention to waste any time on refuting them.86.	An especially pathetic warning was given to African States against Israel's alleged "colonialism’'. We have heard from the representative of Jordan just a moment ago that Israel is not a viable State. We have, of course, no intention of competing in viability with our neighbour State of Jordan, but anybody who has been in Israel and has seen its development knows what we have done since our independence and before that.87.	We are proud of our relations with these new African States. From our contact with them we can testify that they are hardly in need of having others guarding their independence or telling them what to do. If is our conviction that they are quite capable of deciding for themselves with whom they should or should not live in friendship. It an Israeli poultry expert is engaged by an African country, does that make the chickens colonialist chickens? If I
srael and an African country co-operate in shipping services, does that make the vessels imperialist vessels? Are the many hundreds of trainees from these countriesin Israel in agriculture, co-operatives etc. training in colonialism? We know that this is nonsense. The Arabs know that it is nonsense and, what is more important, the Africans themselves know that it is nonsense. The leaders of African countries are not to be frightened by meaningless slogans. They can be relied upon to judge their relations with other countries by the behaviour of those other countries towards them, and not by propaganda speeches in New York. We come to these new. States in friendship, with a sincere desire for constructive co-operation in building and developing and for the sharing of experience. Let Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Jordan engage in healthy competition with us in this respect; let them see whether there is anything in their own experience which others wish to share with them. As long as they ask the African countri
es to co-operate with them only in hatred for Israel, nobody is going to-be impressed.88.	There remains one basic matter. One cannot deny that many countries represented here were at one time at war with each other. There are others that even now have grievances of one kind or another against other Member States. But there is one instance, and rue only, in which Member States declare openly from this rostrum, in the Security Council, in their capitals, from their radio stations, that another Member State has no right to exist and should be put out of existence. This is the position loudly proclaimed by Arab States against Israel. We have now read that on his return to his own country the President of the United Arab Republic, who stood here calling for world peace, in a speech in Aleppo rejected our offer to negotiate peace in the region shared by his country and mine. Is this in keeping with the Charter of the United Nations? Is this in keeping with the obligation that each State takes upon itself when it
is received into membership of the United Nations? Can this Organization overlook such a serious repudiation of the Charter?89.	My delegation sincerely believes that the time is overdue for this Organization to remind the Arab States of their basic obligations.90.	We repeat our call for negotiations—without prior conditions—for disarmament, for peace, or at least for a non-aggression agreement. If there is any truth in the professed fear of Israel expansionism, let us make peace, pledge ourselves to non-aggression and have all our borders internationally guaranteed. We are prepared. We ask the Arab States to agree. When they do, there will be a genuine prospect of ending a conflict of which the world is weary, and of opening up a new vista of progress for our troubled region.
92.	Mrs. ROSSEL (Sweden): In a statement before this Assembly on Friday morning [905th meeting], the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Union of South Africa saw fit to quote from the Swedish Press in regard to what he called the Lapps—they themselves prefer to be called "Same"—a group of people who are mostly nomads, numbering in Sweden about 10,000 and living in the northern part of the country. He said that these Same do not enjoy rights equal to those of ordinary Swedish citizens. I do not think that I should now take up the time of tills Assembly to argue with the Foreign Minister of the Union about this matter. Suffice it to say that he must be very short of arguments in defence of the policies of racial discrimination of the Union Government when he has to refer to the Lapps in order to try to justify these policies. It will be more appropriate to set the record straight in the Special Political Committee when the item on "apartheid" is dealt with there, and accordingly my delegation will revert
to this matter in due course. 94.	Mr. NIELSEN (Norway): The Foreign Minister of the Union of South Africa, in his statement in the general debate, also made reference to articles in the Norwegian Press concerned with the Norwegian Lapps or Same. For the sake of orderliness and for the record, may I inform the Assembly that the Norwegian delegation will reserve its right to reply when the question of racial conflict in the Union of South Africa comes up for discussion in the Special Political Committee. 96.	Mr. JAWAD (Iraq): It is rather a coincidence that I should be the third speaker in succession who wishes to protest against the speech of the Foreign Minister of South Africa.97.	Mr. Louw, the Foreign Minister of the Union of South Africa, in his statement in the general debate, made certain references to my country. These remarks clearly demonstrate appalling ignorance and lack of information about the outside world. This is perhaps a direct result of the self-imposed isolation of the Union Government.
In any case, I feel it is my duty to correct the distorted picture of Iraq presented to the Assembly by the Foreign Minister of South Africa.98.	Before doing that, however, I wish to clarify one basic point. Mr. Louw's central thesis seems to be that the existence of poverty, illiteracy and disease in the less developed countries deprives them of the right and duty of drawing attention to the pitiless and inhumane racist policies of his Government. This theory is not only devoid of logic, but we consider it an insult to the intelligence of this august body.99.	In fact, the representative of the Union Government made a convincing case for the revolution in Iraq. The irony is that either he is totally unaware of the course of events in Iraq since July 1958 or he deliberately and conveniently chose to ignore the sweeping reforms and the monumental efforts of the revolutionary Government to remove the accumulated legacies of centuries of decay and neglect,100.	One other thing is certain. Mr. Louw intentiona
lly omitted to mention the date of every source of information he used. It is important to state that these sources are hopelessly out of date and were published during an era which we have long ago left behind.101.	By way of illustration, I should like to state some facts connected with the subjects to which he referred. The Foreign Minister spoke of a land-ownership system in Iraq which belongs to history. His statement that the land is largely in the hands of sheikhs and urban proprietors is a page out of the past and shows A remarkable degree of ignorance. His reference to debt bondage in present-day Iraq is simply ridiculous.May I take the liberty to inform him of the real situation in this regard. One of the first reforms of our republican Government was the enactment, only a few weeks after the revolution of July 1958, of an agrarian reform law, a landmark of post-revolutionary achievement. A limit was put on land ownership—about 600 acres of irrigated land and 1,200 acres of land dependent on ra
infall. All land above the legal limit has been taken over by the Government, with compensation, and is being redistributed among the landless peasants.102.	The law also created the necessary machinery for the implementation of land reform, the reorganization of agricultural relations, the protection of the rights of agricultural workers and the establishment of agricultural Co-operatives.103.	Mr. Louw's figures regarding education and health in Iraq are equally distorted and misleading. He told the Assembly that only 175,000 children out of 750,000 are at school. For his information, during the last academic year 673,426 pupils, were enrolled in primary schools, or 80 per cent of all children of primary-school age. Total enrolment in schools and colleges was 825,350. The picture for the current year Is considerably brighter. Baring the last two years alone the budget for education was more than doubled. During the same period the number of schools increased by 40 per cent, teachers by 46 per cent, and st
udents by 57 per cent,104.	Instead of one doctor per 8,000 persons, as mentioned by Mr. Louw, the latest available figures show one per 3,000 persons.105.	These are only a few of the relevant accomplishments of our revolution during the short period of two years. The pace of economic and social development in Iraq is the highest among the less developed countries. The present three-year provisional plan of economic development calls for the expenditure of more than one thousand million dollars over and above the regular Government budget. The annual budget itself has increased by more than 60 per cent within two years, to a total of $336 million. Most of this increase is in the fields of health, education, social services and housing.106.	We cannot claim that Iraq is in the forefront with the developed countries. We know that the road before us is long and hard. The important thing is that we are moving speedily and with determination along this road to catch up with the more advanced nations of the worl
d. No effort is being spaced to better the standard of living of our people as rapidly as possible,107.	I regret to have had to take the time of the Assembly in Order to correct the distortions and misconceptions uttered about my country from this rostrum last Friday. I feel, however, that under the same circumstances no representative would have done less. I should add that the remarks of the Foreign Minister of the Union of South Africa about Iraq, besides being completely removed from the truth, were completely irrelevant in the context of the discussion of the universally condemned racial policy of his Government, a policy which shamefully contradicts all accepted human values of modern society and which undermines, the United Nations endeavours for promoting the basis for progress and justice in a large sector of Africa. It is common knowledge that the racial policy of the Union of South Africa expands to all fields of life and completely bars the way of the indigenous population in attaining a better
economic and civil life. The main purpose of the cruel police measures used by the South African Government is to keep the indigenous people in conditions of slavery. Moreover, the exercise of arbitrary rule, ignorance, forced labour, racial segregation—all these demonstrate some of the methods employed by the colonial ruling classes in their endeavour to stifle the aspirations of the African population for a decent living, both materially and politically.108.	If the Foreign Minister reads some recent history, he will find that no force of oppression, however great and cruel, and no despotism, however long-lived, can save the antiquated colonial regime in his country, a regime which is trying to perpetuate a system of exploitation of the native human and material resources for the benefit of the few. The world cannot remain indifferent to this inhumane policy followed, in respect to the native population, by the South African Government, and however hard they try to twist or distort the genuine efforts
o* other countries in their march towards progress and justice, they certainly cannot prevent honest people from seeing and condemning the colonial oppression practised by that Government.109.	We invite Mr. Louw to come to Iraq to witness for himself the material and cultural development we have been able to achieve in recent years, the way we are preparing our people to exercise and enjoy democratic living, and above all to see how people of different races, beliefs and professions are treated equally in all fields of social and political life. We are marching with the current of history and we are bound to succeed. The ruling classes in South Africa are marching against the current, and the great wheel of history is bound to crush them sooner or later. In the last analysis, revolution is perhaps the only way for the colonial peoples to achieve their justice at this juncture in the history of colonialism. Justice is a power: if it cannot construct, it can at least destroy. So the question which we should
be asking is not whether there will be a revolution, but whether it will be beneficial or disastrous.
Mr. WADSWORTH (United States of America): I have asked to speak briefly under the right of reply to the intervention made here yesterday afternoon and evening by the Prime Minister of Cuba.205.	As we all know, most of that speech consisted of charges against the United States. Although con¬fronted with charges of a provocative character , we do not intend to reply in kind, but only in the quiet and constructive tones which Mr. Lodge used in the Security Council on this same subject and to which this Assembly is entitled.-28. This is particularly true when dealing with our sister Republic and neighbour, Cuba, with whom our traditional ties of friendship have been so intimate and so strong. The relations between the Cuban Gov¬ernment and people and the Government and people of the United States have been friendly, cordial and close, and when the present Government of Cuba came into power there was widespread sympathy all over the United States for the aims and ideals, including par¬ticularly those of lan
d reform, which the new Govern¬ment professed, and the United States Government promptly recognized that new Government.229.	I shall not attempt to deal now with the numerous charges which were laid against us yesterday. Most of these charges, which are not new, Iiave already been answered by the United States both in the Security Council and in the Organization of American States, both of which bodies have rejected them. In order that the new Members of the United Nations and others who were not present on those occasions may have the correct facts, however, the United States will make available a document within the next few days dealing fully with the issues involved.230.	At this point I would add just one other word. The United States has constantly sought a constructive approach to the complaints of the; Cuban Government. During the past month the United States has urged utilization of the ad hoc committee created by theOrganization of American States to clarify facts and extend good offices. This
Committee was created by the Seventh Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics at San Jose, Costa Rica, in August 1960.231.	As we have said before, the record of our re¬lations with Cuba is an open book. We are prepared to co-operate with this Committee of which I have spoken and we have urged Cuba's co-operation. So far, Cuba has ignored the efforts of the Organization of American States to deal with the question. We re¬main confident, however, today, in spite of attacks which seek to divide us, that the Cuban people and the American people will remain close in mutual es¬teem and respect, for the simple reason that they are bound by common ideals and aspirations as well as by the links of history, geography and economic well- being.232.	Mr. DEBACLE (Nicaragua) (translated from Spanish): I have come to this rostrum in the exercise of my right of reply, compelled to do so by the refer¬ence made to my country and my Government by the Prime Minister of Cuba in his
statement of yester¬day afternoon. The Prime Minister of Cuba said: "In Nicaragua there is now no longer a government of force but a kind of monarchy which is almost as con¬stitutional as the United Kingdom's, in which power is handed down from father to son" [872nd meeting, para, 73].233.	I was gratified to hear from the lips of the Prime Minister of Cuba that he recognized that there was not a government of force in Nicaragua, for this is indeed the truth. As for its being a constitutional mon¬archy liks that of the United Kingdom, in which ths succession passes from father to son, I venture to disagree with the Prime Minister of Cuba and should like to enlighten this august Assembly on this point.234.	Since its attainment of independence in 1821, Nicaragua has had two historic political parties which at one time or another have held power—the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. In the last elec¬tions, held three years ago, the candidates*for the. Presidency of the Republic were Mr. Edmundo
Amador for the Conservative Party and Mr, Luis A. Somoza for the Liberal Party. Mr. Somoza was elected by a con¬siderable majority, having received a large measure of support from the women voters who were voting in Nicaragua for the first time; The losing candidate, of the Conservative Party, now holds, in accordance with the Nicaraguan Constitution, the position of Senator of the Republic. The Nicaraguan Constitution also pro¬vides that minority parties are entitled to be repre¬sented in the various branches of government. Evidence of this is the presence in our delegation of the Con¬servative Party deputy, Dr. Agapito Fernandez Garcfa.235.	Prompted by true principles of democracy # President Somoza, immediately after taking office,sent to the National Congress a constitutional reform bill under which the re-election ofthe President would be prohibited and, what is more, no relative ofthe P^sident to the fourth degree of consanguinity or p jity could be a candidate to succeed him. This bill was pass
ed by the National Congress and is now a constitutional law of the Republic.236.	The Liberal Government of Nicaragua, which has the country's democratization and the people's rights constantly at heart, guarantees the absolutefreedom of the Press—and this is acknowledged even S by our adversaries—in which the opposition debates j problems with a freedom equal to that reigning in this temple of peace itself. Moreover, in an effort to ; strengthen representative democracy, Nicaragua proposed at the meeting of Foreign Ministers in Chile that observers from the Organization of American States should be present during the next presidential  election, in order to testify to its fairness, honesty  and freedom.2S7. I would conclude by adding that Nicaragua has enacted social legislation giving ample protection to i workers, such as the Labour Code and a Social Security Act which extends benefits to the medical sphere and covers the country's workers from maternity to old i age and death.238.	At the present
juncture, following a comprehen- { sive and realistic study, a land reform bill has been ; submitted to the National Congress.239.	The political, economic and social problems of i Nicaragua concern the Nicaraguan people alone, and only we, the Nicaraguans, are called upon to resolve them.We follow the political development of our sister j nations in the continent wf.th a relative's interest and j concern, but at the same time with respect, and we j adhere to the principle of not interfering in the problems of others.238.	Mr. BISBE ALBERNI (Cuba) (translated from Spanish): I have asked for the floor in the exercise of  my right of reply, so as to answer certain assertions made with regard to the statement delivered yesterday	by our Prime Minister, Fidel Castro.	\239.	The representative of Paraguay objected to our	 Prime Minister's application of the word tyrannical  to the Paraguayan system of government by force. It is not my intention to enter into a lengthy discussion	in order to prove that the Parag
uayan Government is	 of that nature. There was, however, something manifestly ironical in the picture painted for us, by the Paraguayan representative, of a Paraguay which,	 in my view, does not at present exist. The mantle	of democracy does not sit  well on the Paraguay of	  Stroessner; what suits it better is a comparison with  the mournful Paraguay of  Francia, which our Jose Marti described. 240.	The men of America and of all the world's countries represented in this Assembly know that the	 angelic picture of Stroessner’s Paraguay, painted here, does not reflect reality. There is only one opinion  about the Paraguay of today: the opinion of America happens to be that of the world, and it is very difficult	 to conceal or obscure the truth. It is a piece of savage  irony to speak of Paraguayan democracy. Democracy? How can we describe as democratic a regime of force which is piling up, day after day, crimes, tortures   and violations of human rights that are well known to all the peoples of America and
the world? Another puerile picture which it has been sought to offer us here is that of a democratic regime in Nicaragua. In that country there is in fact a dynastic tyranny, for the first of the Somozas has now been succeeded by another Somoza. That is the position in Nicaragua. But it must be emphasized that these dic¬tatorships—and Latin American dictatorships in gen¬eral—owe their existence to their approval by the Government of the United States of America. As Prime Minister Castro very rightly pointed out yesterday, the men in command in the United States prefer to ' rely on dictatorship in Latin America, since that is the course which best facilitates the management of | their monopolistic interests and the exploitation of S our under-developed peoples.245. But I repeat, it is not my purpose to demonstrate  primarily to this Assembly, which is well acquainted with Latin American problems and the problems of the world, that there is a dictatorship in Paraguay and a dictatorship in Nicaragua.
I refer to them only because the representatives of those dictatorships have taken the floor to answer us. I asked to speak [ mainly in order to refute, flatly, a statement which  was made at today's meeting and which is absolutely false. 246. The statement—and it came from the representative of Guatemala—was to the effect that 2,000 soldiers were being trained in the province of Camaguey in preparation for an invasion of Guatemala. How long  will there be attempts to hoodwink people with this I fairy-tale? The revolutionary Government of Cuba has stated, and restated, that it adheres uncompromisingly to the principle of non-intervention. Seeing  that the great danger confronting Cuba itself at the present moment is the possibility of intervention, it would be absurd if our country were to interfere in the affairs of another. What is more, we are ardent and dedicated defenders of the principle of non-intervention. The Guatemalan representative may rest  assured—there are no 2,000 soldiers being traine
d in Camaguey for an invasion of Guatemala.247. Furthermore, we believe—and we have become tired of repeating it—that revolutions are not exported. It is the Paraguayan people that must resolve the prob¬lem of "the existing dictatorship in Paraguay, and the Nicaraguan people that must resolve the problem of ; the existing dictatorship in Nicaragua. The same ap¬plies to the other peoples of America who live under tyrannical regimes. It is they who from within, in their own circumstances and relying on their own resources, have to solve that problem.248. What Cuba does export is its example—the exam¬ple of a group of msn who stood up to a powerful dic¬tatorship that possessed a fully equipped army and was supplied, by representatives of the United States Government, with all the arms it needed. It seemed a i fantasy, a product of the imagination.	It is true, quite true, that Castro found himself with only twelve men in the Sierra Maestra. The ex¬perts said at the time that it was impossible for
him to defeat an army. But to that group of twelve men, others continued to be added. Why? Because they hadthe support of a people. It was not only the twelve men that were in the Sierra Maestra with Castro at the outset who overthrew the powerful dictatorship of Batista. If they had not had the support of the Cuban people, that  would have been impossible.	This is why I say we are exporting our example, the example of a heroic people that proved capableof making every conceivable sacrifice in order to smash the Batista dictatorship.251. That is the fact of the matter, and the point which we must stress: revolutions are not exported; they  must be made by the peoples themselves; but weare setting an example to all the peoples of Latin America. This is what grieves the United States Gov¬ernment, a Government which has been blind to American realities because it has supported dictator¬ships while at the same time boasting that it repre¬sents, for the world, the spirit of democracy, it is impossible bo
th to support dictatorships in America and to represent democracy, and it is impossible to make  its with the Franco regime in Europe and to represent democracy in the eyes of the world.252.	These are the contradictions that exist; these are the contradictions which must be taken into ac¬count. We export our example of struggle; we export our example of sacrifice. The Cuban revolution is like a spur  which is acting upon the spirit of the American peoples. I recall that Socrates was compared to a gad¬fly which went about stinging the citizens, awakening and arousing them. This is the role of the Cuban revo¬lution; it is awakening the peoples of America, it is arousing the consciousness of America; and that is what is causing concern, ^bat is why the United States, wants to destroy the Cuban revolution—not because of a specific ideological position, which was described very clearly yesterday, but because that revolution affects United States interests and makes all our peo¬ples ready for the struggle
ahead. Prime Minister Castro stated yesterday, with complete clarity, that the ideological line of the Cuban revolution is reflected in the principles of the Declaration of Havana.253.	From the very outset, however, attempts were made to attach to us the label of communism. It is well known that, whenever a people fights for social reform the representatives and supporters of the status quo at once proclaim "They are communists; they are opening a front for communism". But people can no longer be fooled by this, either in America, in Africa, or in any other part of the world.254.	I have wished to make this matter absolutely clear in reply to the statement of the representative of Guatemala. Let no one say that Cuba wants to ex¬port revolutions or that it purposes to prepare or dispatch expeditions to invade other countries of our continent. Such things are of no interest to us, and no nation of America need fear any invasion of that sort. Cuba is carrying through its own revolution; it is achieving its o
wn transformation. Is its example hav¬ing an influence? That is something else, something which we cannot avoid.255.	With regard to the reply of the United States representative and the announcement of a United States document on the Cuban question, my answer is simply that I confirm each and every word spoken by Prime Minister Fidel Castro in the formidable accusation which he "delivered against the United States. Those words of his represent our best document on the un¬justified acts of aggression by the United States Gov¬ernment against our country.256.	With this I shall conclude my remarks; but I wish to point out that, although today we have dealt with isolated cases, the Cuban delegation reserves the right to prepare a full answer, in the light of all the criticism which may be advanced and all the at¬tacks which may be made in the course of this general debate—a complete answer to those who challenge the statements of Prime Minister Fidel Castro.
206.	Mr. HERRARTE (Guatemala) (translated from Spanish): In his speech on Tuesday, 27 September 1960 [874Sh meeting], the Guatemalan Minister for Foreign Affairs complained from this rostrum of the threats of certain elements, sponsored by the Cuban Government, to invade Guatemala. Later , at the same meeting, exercising the right of reply, the Cuban dele¬gation gave assurances that Cuba was not intervening and would not intervene in the domestic affairs of other States.207.	Nevertheless, on the instructions of my Govern¬ment, I have come before the Assembly to repeat the charge. On the night of 1 October 1960, a frigate flying no flag but bearing the name La Cubana, was sighted in Guatemalan territorial waters, on the Atlantic side and refused to respond to orders to halt for in¬spection by the port; authorities of Matfas de Galvez. According to reports received by my Government, the frigate was expected by communist elements in contact with the present Cuban Government, and was using the darkness of t
he night to reach the Guatemalan coast. The Guatemalan Air Force compelled it to withdraw from territorial waters and on the following day it was sighted close to the island of Cozumel, listing to port. This news item was sent out by the Press cable agencies and was published in The New York Times, though not in full on 4 October.208.	I should observe that this landing was synchron¬ized with certain disturbances which took place on the morning of 2 October in the capital of Guatemala at the instigation of communist leaders acting on flimsy pretexts.209.	The Guatemalan Government, through the Gene¬ral Assembly, wishes to protest most energetically against these further instances of interference by the Cuban Government in the domestic political affairs of Guatemala, all of which constitute aggression and are endangering the free institutions of Guatemala.211.	Mr. SOEBANDRIO (Indonesia): Knowing well the pressure of time and work upon this session of the General Assembly, it is with some reluctance that I
have requested the right of reply to the statement made yesterday [886th meeting! by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands: The issues raised are so grave that they must be clarified.212.	The Netherlands Foreign Minister has chall¬enged Indonesia to clarify its position and its state¬ments. I am glad to accept this challenge. However, I wish to leave no illusion in the mind of anyone, least of all in the mind of the Netherlands Foreign Minister. By exercising the right of reply, Indonesia does not retreat from the position expressed last week [880th meeting] by President Sukarno on behalf of the Indo¬nesian Government and people. Indonesia makes no form of apology for the considered words used by our President. Indonesia ha» no intention of acting others- wise than, as explicitly indicated by President Sukarno.213.	The Netherlands Foreign Minister referred to the conflict between the Republic of Indonesia and the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This conflict originated in the fact that the
Netherlands still refuses to recog¬nize the complete transfer of sovereignty from the Netherlands East Indies to the independent Republic of Indonesia. It was explicitly agreed that this transfer was to cover the whole territory of the Netherlands East Indies. The Netherlands, a decade later, has still not lived up to this agreement. The conflict began as a political conflict, but during the years it has extended itself, by no fault of ours, to economic matters, and now, unfortunately, and again through no fault of ours, the threat of physical issues is raised.214.	The General Assembly has been told by the representative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands that Indonesia sustains a territorial claim to West Irian. That is not true, Indonesia is not sustaining any terri¬torial claim; we are declaring the right of the Indo¬nesian people to be sovereign and independent within all the territory formerly covered by the Netherlands East Indies. We do not make any claim to any other part of the Indonesian Archip
elago. Indonesia explicitly does not make any claim at all to territory such as that in Borneo or Timor which lies within the Indo¬nesian Archipelago but was not part of the Netherlands East Indies. We are not sustaining a territorial claim; we are sustaining a national claim, and that national claim is the right of our nation to be united and inde¬pendent.215.	In 1950, when the Netherlands recognized our sovereignty, it did not whole-heartedly complete the formal transfer, nor has it yet done so. Indeed, in every part of Indonesia the Netherlands left behind the seeds of unrest and disturbance. I would remind the General Assembly of the military disturbances, caused by the Dutch adventurer Westerling. I would also re-mind the General Assembly of the separatist move¬ments, originated or encouraged by the Netherlands, such as what is usually called the Republic of the South Moluccas. There was political, economic and military subversion. This was beyond question insti¬gated and encouraged by those Dutch
interests which still sought to preserve themselves in our territory and to capitalize on a troubled and turbulent situation. Furthermore, separatism was encouraged not only In the territory of West Irian but also in Java, Sumatra, and other islands.216.	We survived these things, and not only have we survived them, but for the greater part we have eliminated the obstacles to unity and progress left behind by the Netherlands. We have survived, we have eliminated those obstacles and we are growing stronger; and now, anything the Netherlands does against us, be sure that we will meet them on equal terms.217.	I am constantly surprised and amused at the pseudo-scientific arguments advanced concerning al¬leged ethnological differences between the peoples of West Irian and the peoples of the rest of Indonesia. I am amused by this because during the generations of colonialism the Dutch lost no opportunity of arguing scientifically that all the peoples of the Netherlands East Indies were ethnologically related.
Now they are indeed scraping the bottom of a, very empty barrel to controvert their own colonial arguments.218.	It is no part of my intention to enter into the ethnological field. The realities of political life are not dependent upon real or alleged ethnological simi¬larities or differences. If that yardstick is to be ap¬plied, then I await with impatience the Netherlands intervention to ensure that all peoples who are ethnologically different be disunited.219.	We are not making any new claim. I would point out that in Indonesian history there have been moments of great glory and power, such as during the Kingdoms of Modjapahit and Sriwijaja when our territory ex-tended far beyond our present frontiers. Whenever refer to this, and we have no wish to expand to those fron¬tiers. I mention these facts to indicate that the terri¬tory of the Netherlands East Indies was not acci¬dentally delimited.220.	It has become usual that whenever sovereignty is transferred to a new State there is some doubt whether
all parts of the territory should belong to the new State. Attempts at dismemberment are dis¬guised Tinder various; cloaks, including the cloak of self-determination. I may cite as a recent example of this the situationin the Congo (Leopoldville). We cannot afford more Congos, more West Irians. I may indeed ask whether the representative of the United Kingdom is prepared for this type of disguised dismember¬ment, bearing in mind the claims of the Scottish and Welsh nationalists. Or, for that matter, is the United States prepared for this—a country which, a hundred years ago, fought a war on this very question? Obvi¬ously, this is a ridiculous proposition. By saying this, I just want to show what kind of erratic conclusion we can draw from the logic of the Netherlands Foreign Minister.221.	If the United Nations wishes to apply the right of dismemberment—which is what the Dutch are actu¬ally proposing under the cloak of self-determination— then it must be applied to all nations, old and new. Old e
stablished and newly established nations must be measured by the same yardstick.222.	When I speak of applying the same yardstick everywhere, I also cannot refrain from expressing my bewilderment at the exclusive and strangely limited Dutch conception of the right of self-determination. The representative of the Netherlands declared yesterday that Indonesia owed its independent existence to the right of self-determination. I beg to differ. Yes, we exercised the right of self-determination. The whole people of Indonesia exercised this right. But we owe our independent existence to our struggle for national independence. We had to fight for our independent existence because the Dutch refused to recognize the right of self-determination. And what is the record of the Netherlands in other cases? The Netherlands did not support the right of self-determination for the people of Morocco, when that people was struggling for its freedom and submitted its case to the United Nations. The Netherlands did not support in
the United Nations the right of the people of Tunisia to self- determination. Yesterday and today, the Netherlands does not support the right of self-determination of th© Algerian people and they, like the people of Indonesia, have to wrest their independent existence through bitter struggle.223. So what is the Dutch conception of the right of self-determination? It is a perversion of that right. It is a denial of that right. It is the indefinite suspension of that right until conditions, according to the Dutch, warrant the exercise of the right of self-determination —that iti, in the never-arriving future. For Indonesia, the right of self-determination meant, according to the Netherlands, after hundreds of years. But we did not wait hundreds of years. The whole people of Indo¬nesia have exercised their right of self-determination, and that right cannot be negated now..224. What about the Netherlands allegiance to the principles of the United Nations? I would not raise this issue except for the fact
that the Netherlands Foreign Minister declared yesterday that the Presi¬dent of Indonesia had, in his address before this body, threatened to act in a manner contrary to the principles of the United Nations, thereby undermining its authority and jeopardizing the peace,225.	I believe that I can say, without any contradiction from anyone, that Indonesia has never acted or threatened to act contrary to the principles of the United Nations. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the Netherlands. It was the Netherlands which committed an act of aggression against Indonesia, in open defiance of the Security Council. This did not occur so long ago. Certainly, it did not occur so long ago that sensible persons would find it to difficult to conceive of the Netherlands harbouring any idea of aggressive intentions towards Indonesia. The Nether¬lands Foreign Minister said yesterday that this was fantastic. It was perhaps equally fantastic some years ago, but it happened nevertheless. It is hardly for the Nethe
rlands, which has once defied the United Nations, which continues to refuse to be guided by the United Nations principle of negotiation, to accuse any country  including Indonesia, of acting contrary to the principles of the United Nations.226.	Apart from that, what then is the basic threat to peace? In our world, there is today a sustained, irreversible and world-wide drive of peoples and nations to satisfy their basic demands to grow as free, prosperous entities. Opposed to this drive there is colonialism. It is this opposition, it is this colonial¬ism which creates the threat to peace. This is obvi¬ously So in Algeria, for example, and equally obviously so in West Irian. The existence of colonialism in West Irian presents a threat to peace. Whether' his threat comes in terms of physical conflict is immaterial. It, is a conflict in the hearts and minds of men, and this is the basic threat toward peace.-aA227.	Since 1950, as President Sukarno pointed out, we have tried bilateral negotiations and nego
tiations within the United Nations. We continued and perse¬vered with these negotiations even when Netherlands subversion within our country was rampant in the economic, military and political fields. We continued the negotiations, with tolerance and hope. We sought to persuade the Netherlands into a lasting friendship and co-operation with Indonesia, But it could come about only If the Netherlands recognised the complete territorial independence of Indonesia. Unfortunately we failed. We foundered on the rock of Dutch colonial intransigence. We were left with no alternative. We had to take other ways to protect our own interests, to reunite our territory, to outlive Netherlands sub¬version and to eliminate all the obstacles put in out path by reactionary Netherlands colonial interests. 228.	Indeed, we have embarked upon a new course. Now we are .meeting political undermining with po¬litical force. We are meeting economic undermining with economic force and we will meet physical force with physical force
too. This is a national right which cannot be denied. Do not expect us to sit idly by and accept passively hostile Netherlands activities. Do not expect us passively to await a fate dictated by a re¬mote and unrealistic nation. To do so would perhaps ease the mind of the Netherlands Government, but it would mean the end of Indonesia.229.	I say explicitly that Indonesia is determined to meet force with force in any field. This is not a threat; this is a reality which the Netherlands must accept and which the world must accept. Stubbornness has left us no alternative. Statements issued by the Nether¬lands offices of publicity before the aircraft carrier Karel Doorman was despatched to Indonesian waters can be interpreted as a semi-declaration of war. What are we to do? Stand idly by? That we will not do. I say again, we will meet force with force and in doing so we are within our rights and within the spirit, of the Charter of the United Nations.230.	Do not think that we are not filled with regret and sor
row that this situation should have arisen. It is not our fault. We have much to do in our country and it is tragic that so much of our effort and so much of our money must be used in this way. In fact, we, like every nation, cannot afford not to be peaceful. We cannot afford not to struggle for a higher living standard.231.	In his statement yesterday to the General As¬sembly, the Netherlands Foreign Minister said that the Netherlands administration in West Irian has no other aim than to prepare the population of the Terri¬tory, within the shortest possible time, for the exercise of its right of self-determination. He went on to say that it should decide for itself whether it wishes to be an independent country, or to join up with the eastern part of the island, or to become part of Indonesia, or to opt for any other form of political existence.232.	I say clearly that there is no genuine of self-determination contemplated by the Netherlands. The fact is that statements about this are used and misused fo
r the purpose of continuing colonialism. The Netherlands Foreign Minister said that the people may decide to become part of Indonesia. The fact is that they decided to do this, and did it, fifteen years ago.233.	Today, those same people are being subjected to conditioning in order to destroy their right of self- determination, freedom of choice and national unity. I refer the President to a statement made recently by a distinguished member of the Dutch Parliament, Mr. Patijn, who said that the promises made by the Netherlands are so vague that they permit the contem¬plation of a Dutch colonial empire for another thousand years.234.	I would point out also that the reality of the Dutch administration is not by any means like the picture so lightly sketched by the Netherlands Foreign Minister. I do not intend at this moment to embark upon a discussion about these matters, but I will point out that even the Dutch Parliament has been concerned about the deplorable conditions prevailing in West Irian, A Dutch
Parliamentary Mission visited the area last year, and the Dutch administrator was dismissed shortly afterwards.235,	Referring now in more general terms to the ideas advanced by the representative of the Netherlands, I must mention the views expressed by him on the word “revolution". It is indeed elementary knowledge that a large part of the world is in a state of revolution. Any politician or statesman who does not recognize the fact that three-quarters of humanity is at this moment in a state of revolution is blind to history. Only a very small minority in the world is stable. We who are involved in revolution are not opposed to those who are stable. But let them not attempt to prevent the revolutionary changes which are taking place. A revolution is not a question of machine guns clattering in the streets. A revolution is not a matter of killing people. A revolution is a period of rapid and radical change and these changes are based upon human consciousness, human desires and human demands. The world-w
ide revolution of today is a world-wide demand by humanity for equality of freedom, oppor¬tunity, esteem and degree of emancipation. That* is the reality. I am not saying that those who are stable should seek change. That is a question for themselves. I would remind those stable areas, however, that technically advanced thinking does not imply a mono¬poly of wisdom about the new social, political and economic conceptions required for the development of the majority of mankind. In fact, I am amazed at the ignorance and lack of interest in those matters often displayed in the stable quarter of the world.236,	President Sukarno said that we are not perhaps well versed in technical matters but that we are well versed in matters of social, political and economic conception, and in questions of democracy and the application of democracy. That is very true. We have faced so many problems on those fields that they have become part of our very lives. Our knowledge is not academic but severely practical. If we had
not learned how to tackle the manifold problems facing us in those fields, we should long ago have collapsed. If there is dislocation, commotion and turbulence, there is not chaos. Only too often the imminent collapse of Indonesia has been prophesied by Netherlands organs of publicity, but in fact we have grown stronger.237,	It is a reality that the greatest struggle within the world today is not a conflict of ideology but a conflict between those seeking and demanding rapid revolutionary change and those opposing such change. It is a conflict between those seeking to restore or maintain the image of a glorious past and those seeking the reality of a glorious present and future,238,	Even if there were no ideological conflict within our world, there would still be confrontation on this field. This confrontation does not only apply to inter¬national problems but is a problem within nations. However, that conflict between the nations declines as living standards become more level and equalitarian. If a nati
on such as the Netherlands does not understand" this, that nation will become isolated. If the views which the statement of Mr. Luns reflects are contrary to reality, then the Netherlands Foreign Minister will be left behind by the new and decisive forces of history.239,	We are proud of solving our problems in a revo¬lutionary way, a revolutionary way which is quickest and best for our people. We are not frustrated but wo are exhilarated by our daily struggle. It has become clear in Indonesia that our problem is not a merely technical problem but is the problem of finding and applying the right concept for every period, however transient that period may be. It is in this field of political, economic and social activity that Indonesia has a genuine contribution to make to the world.240.	I cannot refrain from referring again to the famous statement by George Canning to which the Netherlands Foreign Minister, like President Sukarno, referred. The level of political and ideological confrontation in the Nethe
rlands is such that a political crisis can be caused by a proposal to raise the price of milk by one cent per pint. This delightfully illus¬trates the contention first expressed by George Canning. Whilst such matters take up the time and energy of Dutch politicians, they have lost the friend¬ship and harmonious co-operation of Indonesia and bid fair to lose the friendship of all Asia and Africa. Has there ever been such a case of penny wise and pound foolish? We need perhaps a new George Canning to make a new aphorism today.242.	Mr. SCHURMANN (Netherlands): I take it that this is not the occasion to start a discussion about the question of Netherlands New Guinea. Such a discussion has been held no less than four times in the United Nations, and four times in succession the General Assembly has refused to accept the thesis that Indo¬nesia came here to defend. Therefore, I shall not go into all the details of that question and I shall not answer all the points made by the representative of Indonesia. What
I wish to do, in just a few words, is to point out a few mistakes and a few things that were incorrect in what he said.243.	In the first place, he started out by mentioning that when we made the agreement with Indonesia by which Indonesia became independent, it was agreed that we would transfer to Indonesia the whole of the territory that had formerly constituted Netherlands East Indies. The Foreign Minister of Indonesia knows just as well as I do that this is not correct. He knows just af well as I do that there was a treaty, called the Act of Transfer of Sovereignty and Recognition^/ and that article 2 of that treaty excepted from the transfer to Indonesia the Territory of Netherlands New Guinea with the stipulation that the fate and future of. that Territory would be decided later on, to be precise, within a period of one year.244.	That was one error that I wish to point out. The Second point that was made by the Foreign Minister of Indonesia was that the Indonesian claim was not a territorial claim b
ut, as he put it, that Indonesia sustained the right of the lndonesian people to be united and independent and that, therefore, Indonesia claimed that the Netherlands should hand over to Indonesia the Territory of Netherlands New Guinea.£5, That argument begs the question because the issue that has kept us divided, and that is still keeping us divided, is, that Indonesia takes it for granted that Netherlands New Guinea is a part of Indonesia and that the population of Netherlands New Guinea wishes  to be a part of Indonesia. But that is exactly the point ] on which we beg to differ because, when Indonesia says that it has already exercised our right of self- 1 determination and the people of Netherlands New Guinea have already exercised that right, what they actually mean is that, when President Sukarno declared the independence of Indonesia in a statement which was j made on 17 August 1945, he did that on behalf also of the population of Netherlands New Guinea. But, as I has been stated many times before
in this hall, there j was at that time no communication whatsoever between ] Netherlands New Guinea and Indonesia. Java had been occupied in the war by the Japanese and at that time was still occupied, and there was not the slightest  possibility for anybody there at that moment to ascer¬tain what the wishes of the population in Netherlands New Guinea were. It therefore seems only fair and - just to us that those who have so often and so elo¬quently pleaded here the cause of self-determination, and who have stated that a people should have the right to decide for itself whether it wants to belong to another country or whether it wants to be inde¬pendent, should also apply that right to the people of Netherlands New Guinea. If Indonesia is right, if those people really do feel that they wish to be part of Indonesia, that will certainly appear at the time when the plebiscite—or whatever the form may be in which the population is consulted—takes place. If the Indo¬nesian thesis is correct, it will app
ear so at that : time-. Therefore, I fail to see what objection Indonesia can possibly raise to our preparing this population in the shortest possible time, as indicated by our Foreign Minister, for the exercise of that right which is laid I down in the Charter of the Organization and which has been defended by so many countries here.246.	The Foreign Minister of Indonesia, apart from pleading his own case, pointed to what he considered J some shortcomings in the thesis of the Netherlands and also in Netherlands actions. He said that, when we ; talk about the right of self-determination, we do not really mean it, I do not think that I need argue that ; point at all that is needed to refute that statement ! is to point to the fact that, a few years ago, the General Assembly accepted the new regulation of our Kingdom under which Surinam and the Netherlands Antilles were given complete self-government and were given a status entirely and exactly equal to that of the Kingdom in Europe. I think that is the best
; proof that we really do take the right of self-determi¬nation seriously, for that decision was taken and that new Constitution was introduced after due consultation in due democratic form—not in the form of unanimity that is presupposed, but in a really democratic form by the population there.247,	There are many other points that I should really like to answer, but I shall not do so. There is only one point that I wish to make. The Foreign Minister of Indonesia said that Indonesia would only meet force with force. The Territory of Netherlands New Guinea is larger than the territory of France. In that whole territory, the Netherlands maintains a few thousand troops. I do not think that anybody can really believe that, with such a small contingent of troops, we could have any evil intentions toward Indonesia. And I can certainly state here on behalf of my Government that there is no question of the Netherlands' wishing any harm to Indonesia or ever having the idea of possibly  attacking Indonesia. Apart
from the physical impossibility, there is certainly no	 intention of our doing so.  Therefore, if Indonesia is sincere in saying that it will use force only if we use force, I can assure the General Assembly that there is no danger, impossibility, there is certainly no danger because we shall certainly never do that. #

+ 119.	Mr. SCHURMANN (Netherlands): The representative of Indonesia has taken exception to the fact that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands drew attention, in his address in this general debate [760th meeting), to some measures taken by the Government of the Republic of Indonesia against the Netherlands and against Netherlands subjects. Mr. Luns stated that these measures had rendered it impossible for our countrymen to continue to live and work in Indonesia. As Mr. All Sastroamldjojo has termed this statement a "wrongful attack" and a "gross misrepresentation" of his country's actions, I consider it my duty to answer him.#
Error: unexpected symbol in "ndonesia against the Netherlands and against Netherlands subjects. Mr. Luns stated that these measures had rendered it impossible for our countrymen to continue to live and work in Indonesia. "#
> 120.	In the first place I would point out that my Indonesian colleague has not denied that the measures mentioned by Mr. Luns have been taken by the Indonesian Government. He acknowledged that Indonesia has repudiated all debts and obligations owed to the Kingdom of the Netherlands; that it has seized and taken over businesses, enterprises—large and small- and property owned by Netherlander in Indonesia; and that it has paid no compensation to the owners and is still unwilling to do so. It is therefore not the facts that are in dispute. What we do disagree on is the evaluation of the facts. In the Netherlands speech they were called "unlawful acts". The representative of Indonesia said that they were "designed to place the relationship between Indonesia and the Netherlands on a new footing of equality and justice" [762nd meeting. para. 841]. If these measures are expressions of equality and justice, then it is a very new kind of equality and justice indeed.#
Error: unexpected symbol in "120.    In"#
> 121.	So far as I know, no lawyer has ever dared to argue that it is in accordance with the rule of equality and justice that a Government should take away from a minority group of foreign nationals, lawfully residing in its territory, everything they possess without paying or offering them any compensation whatsoever.#
Error: unexpected symbol in "121.    So"#
> 122.	Mr. Sastroamldjojo objects to the statement that "during the past year nearly 40,000 Netherlander have been obliged to leave their houses and homes in Indonesia" |760th meeting, para. 381. It was only 9,000 unemployed, he says, who were told to get out of Indonesia; the rest went of their free will—and it was very naughty of them to leave because that "disrupted and crippled the economic, technical and administrative services of [his] country" f762nd meeting. para. 851. So, in the view of the Indonesian representative, it is perfectly all right for the Indonesian Government to take away from a Dutchman living in Indonesia his house, his furniture, his office, his books, his stock and everything connected with his business; but it that Dutchman, having been deprived of everything he possessed and every means of earning a livelihood, then loaves the country which has treated him in that way, that is reprehensible.#

Error: unexpected symbol in "123.    I"#
> 124.	There is only one other point on which I would say a few words. Mr. Sastroamidjojo has stated that the crux of the problem is the still outstanding dispute over West Irian; and, indeed, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia said last year that if the United Nations would not endorse the Indonesian claim to Netherlands New Guinea, his country would "take other action which might harm the Netherlands Interests". The measures taken by Indonesia, which the Netherlands delegation has brought to the notice of the Assembly, would—according to the Indonesian Prime Minister, Mr. Djuanda—have been taken in any case, whatever the results of the voting on the New Guinea question at the twelfth session of the General Assembly. Other Indonesian spokesmen have acknowledged that those measures were intended to force the Netherlands to surrender Netherlands New Guinea to Indonesia.#
Error: unexpected symbol in "124.    There"#
> 125.	If Mr. Djuanda's version is correct, then the Netherlands New Guinea question is irrelevant in this context. If, on the other hand, my Indonesian colleague's statement is true, then Indonesia has committed these acts with the deliberate intent to force the Netherlands to .agree to the surrender of territory in a dispute which Indonesia has refused to submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, and in which the General Assembly has repeatedly rejected the Indonesian arguments and proposals. It seems to me that the representative of Indonesia does not improve his case by invoking such defiance of the United Nations in justification of his country's behaviour.#
Error: unexpected symbol in "125.    If"#
> 126.	Mr. PALAR (Indonesia): I apologize for asking for this opportunity to answer the remarks just made by the representative of the Netherlands. I admit that it Is impossible to continue discussing this question, but I believe that it is necessary for me to put forward two points In order to make clear this conflict between the Dutch and the Indonesians, as well as what has been said by the representative of the Netherlands, with which, I believe, the General Assembly will not agree.#
Error: unexpected symbol in "126.    Mr."#
> 127.	In the first place, Mr. Schtirmann said that we had taken over Dutch enterprises. This action was designed to place the relationship between Indonesia and the Netherlands on a new footing of equality and justice. That is indeed what Mr. Sastroamidjojo said; but it is not all. He also said that these measures were based on laws adopted during the period of Netherlands colonial, rule. Therefore, the measures were adopted according to the laws made by the Dutch for us.#
Error: unexpected symbol in "127.    In"#
> 128.	According to Mr. Schtirmann, Mr. Sastroamidjojo said that the Dutch went away from Indonesia of their own free will, that we did not urge them to go, that they left our country of their ownfree will. I should like to read what Mr, Sastroamidjojo said:#

Indeed, the Netherlands Government urged the immediate mass evacuation of Dutch nationals, although there was no urgency for such a step." f762nd meeting, para. 85.1 I think that this is not precisely what the representative of the Netherlands has just said.#

It will try to deal in that statement with matters of special interest to Jordan. We hope that the report of the Secretary-General, requested in the resolution which was adopted by the General Assembly at its third emergency special session [resolution 1237 (ES-in)]. on the proposal of the Arab States, will be before the Assembly by then, so that my delegation will be able to discuss it at that time. However, the speech of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom, which we have just heard, gives my delegation the opportunity to express some early views on behalf of the Jordanian Government regarding the withdrawal of British troops from Jordan.#

Mr. RIF A'I (Jordan): In his statement before the General Assembly yesterday [768th meeting], the Soviet Foreign Minister deemed it necessary to refer to my Government in more than one instance and to confuse the present problem of the Middle East in more than one attempt. Mr. Gromyko dealt with three different questions: first, the Arab resolution [1237 (ES-mll of which Jordan was a co-sponsor; secondly, the withdrawal of British troops from Jordan; and thirdly, the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of this resolution [A/3934/Rev.ll.#

Error: unexpected symbol in "168.    Inasmuch"#
> 169.	It will be recalled that since the report of the Secretary-General was circulated, a number of representatives have dealt with the present situation in the Middle East as part of their main statement in the general debate. Of these, two besides the Jordanian delegation were Arab representatives, co-sponsors of the resolution under discussion. It is noteworthy that with the exception of the representative of the Soviet Union, none of these representatives took a critical stand in regard to the report of the Secretary- General or attempted to complicate the issue. Such an attitude on the part of the Soviet Union delegation is no doubt further evidence of the obstructionist policy of the Soviet Government in questions pertaining to inter-Arab relations.#

The Jordanian delegation, as one of the sponsors of the resolution, does not agree to the Soviet interpretation of it. We wish to make it clear that we consider that the report of the Secretary-General represents a correct interpretation of that resolution: I should like to point out that at the time of the drafting of the resolution of the Arab States, the Jordanian delegation knew that the Soviet delegation Was' not happy about the phrase which reads "and thereby facilitate the early withdrawal". But in view of the wishes of the overwhelming majority, the Soviet delegation had no choice but to withdraw its own draft resolution and support ours. Now that they find the resolution properly and correctly construed, they again feel unhappy about it.#

Mr. LUKANOV (Bulgaria) (transacted from Russian); when we spoke in the general debate f765th meeting), our delegation had not had an opportunity of studying carefully the Secretary-General's first report [A/3934/Rev.H] on the implementation of the resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 21 August 4958 at its third emergency special session [resolution 1237 (ES-np). The matter is of such outstanding importance that we cannot pass it over in silence. The adoption of the resolution of 21 August was greeted with relief by the people of the world and increased their hopes in the potentialities of the United Nations. There can be no doubt that these hopes were contingent upon the rapid and unconditional implementation of the resolution. However, in the past six weeks the hope that the situation the Middle East would be brought back to normal has not been realized; despite the resolution of the emergency special session, United States forces are still occupying Lebanon and United Kingdom forces are sti
ll occupying Jordan. No one can be satisfied by the symbolic gesture of the withdrawal of a few units, which has been represented to us here as an alleged proof of goodwill. The publicizing of such symbolic gestures may improve the position of certain political leaders of the United States, when the pressure of public opinion becomes too strong, but it can in no way change the facts. The facts are that foreign troops are still in Lebanon and Jordan, that they are in no hurry to leave and that their presence there is appreciably aggravating the situation in those countries.#

> 31.	The question of the unconditional implementation of the resolution of 21 August 1958 is not a limited or a local problem. This question is of great international significance and it is most acute. It cannot fail to interest all delegations. However, attempts have been made here to minimize the importance of the problem and to persuade us that this is a question which concerns only the King of Jordan, or very nearly. We feel obliged to protest vigorously against attempts to foster the notion that, when the United States and United Kingdom forces are sent to various parts of the world, in this case the Near and Middle East, this is of no concern to countries which are net directly affected, that is to say, countries in whose territories foreign troops have not been landed. It is in the colonialists' interests to carry out their aggression on the quiet, so to speak, and to allow no voice to be raised in defence of the nations which are their victims. In the case of Anglo-American aggression in the Middle
East, no one can be expected to ignore the fact that the most substantive part of the General Assembly resolution of 21 August 1958, that providing for the speedy withdrawal of foreign troops, is not being implemented. That resolution is of Interest to everyone and concerns everyone. This is not only an Arab problem. While it is true that the intervention of the United States and the United Kingdom in Lebanon and Jordan has most directly affected the Arab countries, it is also true that the interests of all peoples fully Coincide with those of the Arab peoples, which are fighting to do away with the remnants of colonialism and to prevent interference by imperialist Powers in their domestic affairs.#

It la indeed high time to allow the Arab peoples to settle their domestic affairs in their own way, to achieve full State sovereignty and-national independence and to start remedying their economic backwardness, which is the more unjustifiable in view of the fact that these countries possess incalculably rich mineral resources. The United States and the United Kingdom must once and for all abandon their ambition to lay down the law to the Arab peoples concerning what Governments they should or should not have. The Bulgarian people supports the legitimate struggle of the Arab East for its independence. The interests of the Bulgarian people fully coincide with the interests of those peoples fighting for their Independence. Accordingly, when we speak of the situation which has arisen in the Near and Middle East as a result of the presence of United States and United Kingdom forces in Lebanon and Jordan, we, the Bulgarian delegation, have in mind not only the Interests of the Arab peoples, but the interes

The Bulgarian people cannot remain Indifferent to the fact that, in a country which lies near Bulgaria there is a concentration of all kinds of armed forces and armaments belonging to a State which has on many occasions openly expressed disapproval of our social structure and the hope that it may be changed.#

Although we do not wish to minimize the Secretary-General's efforts, we feel obliged to express our disappointment at the fact that his first report gives no clear answer to the question when the armed forces of the United States and the United Kingdom will be withdrawn, to the last man, from Lebanon and Jordan. 38.	The Secretary-General's report was eagerly awaited, not only by the representatives at this session of the General Assembly, but by the peoples of the whole world, in the hope that the threat of war created by the United States and the United Kingdom in the Near and Middle East would be promptly removed. But neither the report nor the annexed memoranda from the Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom make it clear when this action, which would promote peace, will be completed. On the contrary, it is obvious from these documents that a number of conditions and, moreover, vague and indefinite conditions, open to all kinds of Interpretations and allowing for arbitrary delays,
have been advanced for the final withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon and Jordan, There is a well-known proverb that with the help of one "if", Paris can be thrust into a bottle. Where the word "if" is used, it is clear that the given decision will not be carried out. We categorically protest against these "ifs" with which the whole report of the Secretary-General and the annexes thereto are interlarded.

If this is not shameless interference by a foreign Power in the affairs of an independent State, we may well ask what is.

At the same time, there can be no doubt that
the presence of United States forces in Lebanon is aggravating internal conditions in that country and that United States leaders are delaying the withdrawal of forces with a view to achieving certain objectives which run counter to the interests of peace.

Some of the speakers who have preceded me have made known their views on this document. The Iraqi delegation feels obliged at this stage in the debate to comment on a particular aspect dealt with by the Secretary-General in his report. This question is one to which the Government of Iraq attaches considerable importance, and one which continues to cause unrest in the Middle East and to threaten international peace. With that consideration in mind, we feel that we should give a brief account of our delegation's views on this problem.#

The Secretary-General undertook extensive travels in our area, and we are convinced that his direct contact with the serious problems which concern us have enabled him to appreciate the danger of the presence of foreign troops in Lebanon and Jordan. It must have been borne in on him, in particular, that the stationing of. those troops there, which gave rise to an alarming state of tension, is the cause of the continuing political and economic difficulties and of friction between the different States in a part of the world which, as is now quite obvious, is a vital spot.#

However, we deem it essential to stress here and now our belief that the slightest delay in withdrawing foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan is a dangerous infringement of the terms of the resolution adopted unanimously on 21 August 1958. It may be appropriate to recall that the Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom stated at the third emergency special session of the General Assembly that the troops they had felt called upon to send to Lebanon and Jordan were there at the request of the Governments of those two countries, and justified their action on the ground that they wished to guarantee the independence of those two States and to ensure their security. I may also recall that we have already had occasion to question the reasons given to justify the sending of the troops. During the same period, other military concentrations were observed in other parts of the area, and we still belie
ve that those moves were inspired by other hidden motives. At all events, and whatever the pretext may be there appears to be no further justification for such activities today. A new Government has been established in Lebanon, and the agreement between the United Kingdom and Jordan on the need for the withdrawal of troops has been made public. While the provisions of that agreement are promising in themselves, it is obvious from the attitude of the United Kingdom Government that it has reservations.#

In its letter to the Secretary-General of 1 October 1958 [A/3937] the United Kingdom Government specified the date on which the withdrawal of troops was to begin, but it was careful not to set any time limit to the operation, merely stating that the duration of the withdrawal would depend on the time required for the evacuation of men and equipment. Decision regarding the time required seems to be left entirely to the United Kingdom command in the area, and apparently it has not been thought necessary to set even an approximate time limit. We cannot help being surprised and indeed disturbed at this failure to be specific, particularly since any unnecessary delay in the withdrawal called for by the General Assembly resolution cannot but further complicate the political and economic 4 situation in the area and thus increase the threat to international peace.#

With particular reference to Iraq, it should' be noted that the armed forces of the United States and the United Kingdom landed in the immediate vicinity of our national territory on the very next day after the establishment of a new regime chosen by the people. Even if that were only a coincidence, it would none the less be reason enough for us to re main vigilant and to take the necessary protective measures to safeguard our security. That we have been forced to take such measures is bound to affect not only our good relations with the United States and the United Kingdom, but also the traditional bonds of common interest between Iraq and other countries, including the neighbouring States. The situation thus created prevents us under the present circumstances from according the usual facilities which so greatly contribute to our maintaining good understan

It is extremely important for Iraq to maintain and develop these neighbourly relations, which safeguard the peace and security of the area. 6.	Worse still, the continuing presence of foreign troops in Lebanon and Jordan tends to isolate those two countries from the other Arab States, thus keeping alive in the Arab world an atmosphere of mistrust and misunderstanding wholly incompatible with the brotherly relations which should prevail among the members of the League of Arab States.#

In the light of these comments, inspired by the fact that a starting date for the withdrawal of foreign troops has been fixed while no date has been set for the end of the withdrawal operations, it is clear that the United States and the United Kingdom have not acted in full accord with the spirit of the resolution unanimously adopted by the General Assembly. Hence, despite attempts to present the matter to international public opinion in an optimistic light, the threat to peace in the Middle East continues and will continue as long as foreign troops remain in Jordan and Lebanon or in either of the two countries. I can say without fear of exaggeration that the absence of any time limit to the withdrawal of foreign troops renders meaningless the unanimous resolution which appeared to have provided such a fortunate solution of the Middle East problem. This capital omission, which contravenes both the spirit and the letter of the General Assembly’s decision,' is the cause of the continuing threat to wor
ld peace in the area. Furthermore, leaving aside the wishes of the General Assembly and the parties concerned, this deliberate vagueness as regards the full implementation of the provisions of the resolution is contrary to the United Nations Charter itself.#

Mr. GROMYKO (Union of Soviet Socialist Repub-lics) (translated from Russian): During the present general debate, the Soviet delegation has stated the the position of the Soviet Government [750th meeting] on a number of important questions to be dealt with by the General Assembly. It has also given a general appreciation of the existing international situation, which may be described as very strained and fraught with the danger of a serious military outbreak. If that were to happen, it might plunge mankind into the maelstrom of an atomic war of extermination.#

If my delegation has thought fit to speak once more in the general debate, the only reason is that with regard to one important question which concerns, and indeed cannot fail to concern, the General Assembly and all the States represented in the United Nations, a new factor has appeared which cannot be passed over in silence. We have in mind the situation which has now arisen in connexion with the withdrawal of United States and United Kingdom troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The report just presented by the Secretary-General [A/3934/Rev.ll prepared at the request made by the General Assembly at its recent special session, deals with this very question.#

Taking the main point first, can we say that effect has been given to the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its special session, the purpose of which was to obtain the early withdrawal of United States and United Kingdom troops from the Near East? We all know that it has not. There are still United States and United Kingdom troops in the territory of Lebanon and Jordan, although there has been no lack of noisy publicity about their imminent withdrawal. This shows that the danger to peace in the area of the Near and Middle East, which arose as a result of the aggression by the United States of America and the United Kingdom against Lebanon and Jordan, has not been lessened a whit.#

There has been one diplomatic measure after another, different kinds of pressure have been brought to bear by the United States and United Kingdom Governments on Lebanon and Jordan, but the policy of the United States and the United Kingdom has remained the same: to postpone as long as possible compliance with the decision about the withdrawal of their troops and to continue in their role as occupying Powers, with all the consequences.#

Error: unexpected symbol in "24.     We"#
> 25.	First argument. It is said that before the troops can be completely withdrawn, a radical improvement must be achieved in the relations between Arab States and that unless such an improvement takes place there is some danger that if the United States and United Kingdom tanks, aircraft, guns and military personnel were removed from Lebanese and Jordanian soil, and if the United States and United Kingdom warships, which for a considerable period now have kept their gun muzzles trained on Lebanon and Jordan, were to leave their shores, then the prospects of friendlier relations among the Arab countries might deteriorate. But, first, for the imperialist Powers to take upon themselves the role of judges in regulating relations between countries of the Arab East is an absurdity, since everybody knows that they are only waiting for an opportune moment to seize some of these countries by the throat. Secondly, this requirement is in blatant contradiction with the letter and spirit of the General Assembly resolu
tion, which does not and could not (I would stress that—it could not) contain any condition of that sort , for the withdrawal of United States and United Kingdom troops. To make the withdrawal of troops dependent on a radical improvement of relations between the Arab countries When the Western Powers are in fact hindering such an improvement must mean that these Powers have plans for continued aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, with all its attendant consequences. Further evidence of the insincerity of that requirement is that the presence of United States and United Kingdom troops in Lebanon and Jordan is in itself a serious obstacle to the unity of the Arab States. Such unity is just what the United States and the United Kingdom do not want. The main reason why the Arab States have not yet achieved the unity they should have is the imperialist policy of those two Western Powers, a policy of setting the Arab States against one another, in the belief that the longer their various differences are perpe
tuated, the easier it will be for the two Powers to carry out their policy. The United States and the United Kingdom seek every pretext to postpone withdrawing their troops precisely because they are fully aware that to do so Would help to unite the Arab peoples and to remove the various differences which exist between the Arab States. Any r one who really wants good relations to obtain between the Arab States would blush to defend the occupation of Lebanon and Jordan by foreign forces, or the ag-gressive policy of the Western Powers towards the Arab States, or the delay in the withdrawal of their troops from Lebanon and Jordan,#

> United States troops could not leave Lebanon until the new President took office and a new Lebanese Government was formed. But the new President, General Chehab, has taken office and a new Lebanese Government uas been formed. One would have thought that those wfro had delayed the withdrawal of their  forces witL the excuse that the new Government had not been formed would now withdraw them imme-diately. This, however, has not happened, and now a new argument has been put forward to the effect that the forces should not be withdrawn until the situation in Lebanon has become stabilized. We know, howevei', that, first", the very presence of United States troops in Lebanese territory is a way of exerting pressure on Lebanon enabling imperialist circles to cause provocations of various kinds and use them as justi-fication for their actions. Secondly, the way the Lebanese settle their internal affairs is no concern of the Americans, the United States Government, or anyone else. Why should they have to do it und
er the threat of United States machine guns? If we accept that those who attempt to justify the delay in with-drawing the United States forces from Lebanon on the ground that the situation is unstable are acting for the good of Lebanon, it is difficult to say what would constitute gross interference in Lebanon's internal affairs and a flouting of those United Nations principles which protect States from such interference. Third argument. It is claimed that the date for the withdrawal of United States forces from Lebanon must be fixed in agreement with the Lebanese Government and at its request. It is well known, however, that the new Lebanese Government asked for such withdrawal a long time ago and has said on a number of occasions that the sooner these forces leave ,the better. It is true that the Lebanese Government has not openly and officially asked for the withdrawal of United States forces by a certain date, as far as.we are aware. But let us be frank,, gentlemen. The Lebanese Government is in a diffi
cult position—not only are there foreign troops in Lebanese territory, but they are also occupying the capital of the country, so that the Lebanese Government is carrying on its work within range of their rifles. You can judge for yourselves under what conditions the talks between the United States Government and its generals in Lebanon on the one hand, and the Lebanese Government on the other, are proceeding. I think we can all agree that these conditions are extremely difficult and that this enables the United States Government and the United States military command to put daily, or even hourly, pressure on the Lebanese Government, which, in fact, is what they are doing. Have we not all read in today's papers, published here in the United States, that pres-sure by the United States Government has reached the peak where it has demanded that the Lebanese Gov-ernment should be changed to include persons more acceptable to the United States? In front of the whole World, virtually holding the Lebanese Govern
ment at pistol point, Washington is blatantly and shamelessly interfering in Lebanese affairs. For these recent actions alone the United States Government should be present here in the Assembly in the role of the accused party and should be made to answer before the whole world for its brutal coercion of a small Arab State, Indeed, all small countries, and not only the Arab States, whose representatives are here in the Assembly hall, cannot but realize that if Lebanon is not protected against such actions, the fate that Is Lebanon's today may befall them tomorrow, and It is the aggressor who will decide which of them is to be the next victim. The question arises, should the General Assembly act on this, or is it to turn a deaf ear to the cries 6f a victim of aggression, cries which are not always heard through the thick walls of the Assembly hall for the simple reason that the victim is not allowed to voice his protest out loud. It is therefore fime to discount any claims that the wishes of the ! * iError:

> 28.	Now for the fourth argument. It is still being claimed that it Would be awkward for the United States to withdraw its forces from Lebanon while the withdrawal of United Kingdom troops from Jordan remains undecided. This argument is also painfully transparent and is only used to avoid responsibility. Everyone has known for a long time that the United States and the United Kingdom are hand in glove in this matter. The United Kingdom makes the United States its'excuse, and vice versa, and each uses the other to justify in the eyes of the world its own actions—in ti ls particular case, its delay in withdrawing its troops. If ihe United States Government were to state clearly, without conditions or reservations, that it would withdraw its troops in the very near future, If it were actually to do so, the fact would be bound to Influence the United Kingdom. I do not think anyone would dispute the; validity of this proposition. On the other hand, if the United States Government continues to delay the final
withdrawal of its forces on various transparent excuses, pointing to the United Kingdom at the same time, the fact can be used by the United Kingdom Gov-ernment to. avoid withdrawing troops from Jordan in the immediate future. If the United States and United Kingdom Governments continue to employ these tac-tics, the only possible conclusion is that they are con-spiring together, even as they did in the original aggression against Lebanon and Jordan.#

> 29.	I come to the fifth argument. We are told every now and then that in the event of, a United Kingdom withdrawal from Jordan, the latter will be liable to attack by Israel. We consider that this story has al-ready been sufficiently discredited, since everyone knows that an attack by Israel on Jordan would in actual fact be an attack by the United States and the .United. Kingdom. Israel would obviously not lift a finger without their sanction and encouragement. Since the argument is still being repeated, however, it-would not be out of place to say a few words about it. If the United States and the United. Kingdom continue to intimidate Jordan by speaking of a possible attack by Israel, .they will clearlybe doing so deliberately, in order to hinder the withdrawal of their forces, and, if so, they will bear full responsibility for the per-formance which they stage from time to time, in which they assign the leading part to Israel.#

We all know, however, that such is not the case and that the resolution arose out of a debate on the question of withdrawing United States and United Kingdom troops from Lebanon and Jordan, and that the session was convened for consideration of this particular question and no other.

If my delegation has thought fit to speak once more in the general debate, the only reason is that with regard to one important question which concerns, and indeed cannot fail to concern, the General Assembly and all the States represented in the United Nations, a new factor has appeared which cannot be passed over in silence. We have in mind the situation which has now arisen in connexion with the withdrawal of United States and United Kingdom troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The report just presented by the Secretary-General [A/3934/Rev.l prepared at the request made by the General Assembly at its recent special session, deals with this very question.#

Taking the main point first, can we say that effect has been given to the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its special session, the purpose of which was to obtain the early withdrawal of United States and United Kingdom troops from the Near East? We all know that it has not. There are still United States and United Kingdom troops in the territory of Lebanon and Jordan, although there has been no lack of noisy publicity about their imminent withdrawal.

We shall deal only with those arguments which the United States and United Kingdom Governments have used recently, that is, since the United Nations took its decision on the early withdrawal of United States and United Kingdom forces from the Near East, as they have a direct bearing on any appreciation of the present position regarding the withdrawal of troops, a question which is at the moment of prime importance and which the Assembly cannot by-pass.#
Error: unexpected symbol in "24.     We"#
> 25.	First argument. It is said that before the troops can be completely withdrawn, a radical improvement must be achieved in the relations between Arab States and that unless such an improvement takes place there is some danger that if the United States and United Kingdom tanks, aircraft, guns and military personnel were removed from Lebanese and Jordanian soil, and if the United States and United Kingdom warships, which for a considerable period now have kept their gun muzzles trained on Lebanon and Jordan, were to leave their shores, then the prospects of friendlier relations among the Arab countries might deteriorate. But, first, for the imperialist Powers to take upon themselves the role of judges in regulating relations between countries of the Arab East is an absurdity, since everybody knows that they are only waiting for an opportune moment to seize some of these countries by the throat. Secondly, this requirement is in blatant contradiction with the letter and spirit of the General Assembly resolu
tion, which does not and could not (I would stress that—it could not) contain any condition of that sort , for the withdrawal of United States and United Kingdom troops. To make the withdrawal of troops dependent on a radical improvement of relations between the Arab countries When the Western Powers are in fact hindering such an improvement must mean that these Powers have plans for continued aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, with all its attendant consequences. Further evidence of the insincerity of that requirement is that the presence of United States and United Kingdom troops in Lebanon and Jordan is in itself a serious obstacle to the unity of the Arab States. Such unity is just what the United States and the United Kingdom do not want. The main reason why the Arab States have not yet achieved the unity they should have is the imperialist policy of those two Western Powers, a policy of setting the Arab States against one another, in the belief that the longer their various differences are perpe
tuated, the easier it will be for the two Powers to carry out their policy. The United States and the United Kingdom seek every pretext to postpone withdrawing their troops precisely because they are fully aware that to do so Would help to unite the Arab peoples and to remove the various differences which exist between the Arab States. Any r one who really wants good relations to obtain between the Arab States would blush to defend the occupation of Lebanon and Jordan by foreign forces, or the aggressive policy of the Western Powers towards the Arab States, or the delay in the withdrawal of their troops from Lebanon and Jordan,#

> #
> United States troops could not leave Lebanon until the new President took office and a new Lebanese Government was formed. But the new President, General Chehab, has taken office and a new Lebanese Government has been formed. One would have thought that those who had delayed the withdrawal of their  forces witt the excuse that the new Government had not been formed would now withdraw them immediately. This, however, has not happened, and now a new argument has been put forward to the effect that the forces should not be withdrawn until the situation in Lebanon has become stabilized. We know, however, that, first the very presence of United States troops in Lebanese territory is a way of exerting pressure on Lebanon enabling imperialist circles to cause provocations of various kinds and use them as justification for their actions. Secondly, the way the Lebanese settle their internal affairs is no concern of the Americans, the United States Government, or anyone else. Why should they have to do it under the
threat of United States machine guns? If we accept that those who attempt to justify the delay in with-drawing the United States forces from Lebanon on the ground that the situation is unstable are acting for the good of Lebanon, it is difficult to say what would constitute gross interference in Lebanon's internal affairs and a flouting of those United Nations principles which protect States from such interference. Third argument. It is claimed that the date for the withdrawal of United States forces from Lebanon must be fixed in agreement with the Lebanese Government and at its request. It is well known, however, that the new Lebanese Government asked for such withdrawal a long time ago and has said on a number of occasions that the sooner these forces leave ,the better. It is true that the Lebanese Government has not openly and officially asked for the withdrawal of United States forces by a certain date, as far as we are aware. But let us be frank,, gentlemen. The Lebanese Government is in a difficult p
osition—not only are there foreign troops in Lebanese territory, but they are also occupying the capital of the country, so that the Lebanese Government is carrying on its work within range of their rifles. You can judge for yourselves under what conditions the talks between the United States Government and its generals in Lebanon on the one hand, and the Lebanese Government on the other, are proceeding. I think we can all agree that these conditions are extremely difficult and that this enables the United States Government and the United States military command to put daily, or even hourly, pressure on the Lebanese Government, which, in fact, is what they are doing. Have we not all read in today's papers, published here in the United States, that pressure by the United States Government has reached the peak where it has demanded that the Lebanese Government should be changed to include persons more acceptable to the United States? In front of the whole World, virtually holding the Lebanese Government at
pistol point, Washington is blatantly and shamelessly interfering in Lebanese affairs. For these recent actions alone the United States Government should be present here in the Assembly in the role of the accused party and should be made to answer before the whole world for its brutal coercion of a small Arab State, Indeed, all small countries, and not only the Arab States, whose representatives are here in the Assembly hall, cannot but realize that if Lebanon is not protected against such actions, the fate that Is Lebanon's today may befall them tomorrow, and It is the aggressor who will decide which of them is to be the next victim. The question arises, should the General Assembly act on this, or is it to turn a deaf ear to the cries 6f a victim of aggression, cries which are not always heard through the thick walls of the Assembly hall for the simple reason that the victim is not allowed to voice his protest out loud. It is therefore time to discount any claims that the wishes of the Lebanese Government

> 28.	Now for the fourth argument. It is still being claimed that it Would be awkward for the United States to withdraw its forces from Lebanon while the withdrawal of United Kingdom troops from Jordan remains undecided. This argument is also painfully transparent and is only used to avoid responsibility. Everyone has known for a long time that the United States and the United Kingdom are hand in glove in this matter. The United Kingdom makes the United States its excuse, and vice versa, and each uses the other to justify in the eyes of the world its own actions—in this particular case, its delay in withdrawing its troops. If the United States Government were to state clearly, without conditions or reservations, that it would withdraw its troops in the very near future, If it were actually to do so, the fact would be bound to Influence the United Kingdom. I do not think anyone would dispute the; validity of this proposition. On the other hand, if the United States Government continues to delay the final w
ithdrawal of its forces on various transparent excuses, pointing to the United Kingdom at the same time, the fact can be used by the United Kingdom Government to. avoid withdrawing troops from Jordan in the immediate future. If the United States and United Kingdom Governments continue to employ these tactics, the only possible conclusion is that they are conspiring together, even as they did in the original aggression against Lebanon and Jordan.#

> 29.	I come to the fifth argument. We are told every now and then that in the event of, a United Kingdom withdrawal from Jordan, the latter will be liable to attack by Israel. We consider that this story has al-ready been sufficiently discredited, since everyone knows that an attack by Israel on Jordan would in actual fact be an attack by the United States and the .United. Kingdom. Israel would obviously not lift a finger without their sanction and encouragement. Since the argument is still being repeated, however, it-would not be out of place to say a few words about it. If the United States and the United. Kingdom continue to intimidate Jordan by speaking of a possible attack by Israel, .they will clearly be doing so deliberately, in order to hinder the withdrawal of their forces, and, if so, they will bear full responsibility for the performance which they stage from time to time, in which they assign the leading part to Israel.#

We all know, however, that such is not the case and that the resolution arose out of a debate on the question of withdrawing United States and United Kingdom troops from Lebanon and Jordan, and that the session was convened for consideration of this particular question and no other.

To many of the representatives, these verbal assaults are presumably familiar from past years. For others, however, less accustomed to them, it may be appropriate very briefly to offer a different perspective. It is perhaps unnecessary to remind this Assembly that the restoration of Israel as an independent State among the nations represents the fulfilment of thousands of years of history, Down the corridors of time, the Jews, scattered and uprooted, clung tenaciously to their identity as a people and to their hope for their national restoration in the land of Israel.#

The Peace Conference and the League of Nations, in recognizing the claims to emergent statehood of the Arab peoples of the Middle East within their vast ter iltories, affirmed the right also of the Jewish people to their own national home.in their own modest but historic land, Israel. Twenty-five years later, in 1947, the United Nations reaffirmed [resolution 181 (II)] this earlier decision of the international community and called for the partition of Palestine and the setting up there of separate Jewish* and Arab States. Had the Arab countries accepted this compromise resolution of 29 November 1947, the history of our region may well have been one of constructive development, side by side and in mutual co-operation, for the benefit of both, of the two great branches of the Semitic peoples.#

However, should anyone speak of the right of self-determination, Israel must keep silent. Israel has no word, has no say on the subject. The whole disaster of the Palestine question is the result of the denial, of the dismissal of the right of the principle of self-determination. The Palestine case in 1947 here in the United Nations was advocated by the Arabs as one of self-determination. The record is there on the books of the United Nations.

The refugee problem would not have arisen and Israel would not have emerged. Israel's very existence today is not a fulfilment but a denial of the right of self-determination, the right of a people deeply rooted in this Hall from time immemorial. Israel occupies its seat today on the debris, the ashes, the remains of the principle of self-determination—destroyed and thrown to the winds. Had that right been respected, Israel would not have been seated here in the United Nations; it would not be able to speak so lavishly, so extravagantly and so mercilessly on the principle of self-determination. What is more, these Israel gentlemen woul

The spokesman from Israel offered immediate negotiations with the Arab leaders to settle what he called Arab-Israel problems. This is a fallacious offer. There are no Arab-Israel problems. There is the Palestine problem which first and foremost belongs to the people of Palestine—and there is no other problem. The spokesman from Israel has argued with Mr. Fawzi that there is no such thing as the Palestine question; that was his main contention, there is no such thing as the Palestine question. Well, what is there to negotiate when the very existence of the Palestine question is questionable. It stands arguable, even by its name, and its existence is denied. And still we have the courage to offer negotiations for a problem, which according to them, does not exist. Let us talk sense. Let us not talk in the air. What are the matters to be negotiated? The Palestine question comprises three main problems, already decided
by the United Nations resolutions: first, the question of the refugees; secondly, the internationalization of Jerusalem; and thirdly, the territorial aspect in Palestine. Regarding repatriation, Israel is not willing to repatriate one single refugee to his homeland. On the question of Jerusalem, Israel resists the interim nationalization of Jerusalem. On the territorial aspects, Israel will not concede one iota of the territory it holds.

The reasons why the Portuguese Government, faithful to the constitution of the nation, replied in the negative to the Secretary-General’s inquiry should be well known to this Assembly as they have been clearly explained to previous Assemblies by the Chairman of our delegation. Portugal does not administer any territories covered by Article 73, sub-paragraph, of the Charter. National constitutions are the legal expression of social reality. The historical, geographical and political position of my country led Portugal to what has been defined as the "Non-Europe". The other great institutions for multi-racial communities, when instrumental in the formation of the country and its collective ideals, together with the consequent absence of racial prejudices, led Portugal to the creation of true local communities by miscegenation, spiritual assimilation, and inter-relation of cultures and interests. Thus the Portuguese people, by strength of spirit, not by force of arms, became one people dispersed throu
ghout four continents, and kept a genuine feeling of community united by the same national faith.#

This social reality cemented by centuries, this absolute unity of the Portuguese people, makes us a certainly unusual example of an egalitarian, multiracial society, corresponding with a political unity of all territories.

Furthermore, Article 5 of the Portugal Constitution provides equality before the law as everyone, regardless of origin, may participate, and does participate, in the administrative life of the nation or in the making of the laws.#

As an expression of the true unity mentioned before, the political unity of the territory and the unity of the people, the Portuguese estate is a unitary republic with only one Supreme Court which secures the equal interpretation of the law to all. There is only one National Assembly elected by direct universal suffrage. As a final result of these realities, the sovereignty of the Portuguese nation is one and indivisible, and it cannot, therefore, acknowledge any specific international status which would differentiate between parts of the same national territory. Such an international status would have to be applicable to non-self-governing territories, which is entirely outside the Portuguese case, for it is clearly defined in the constitutional structure of Portugal that all parts of the national territory and their respective populations are independent with the independence of the nation. We could not discriminate against this segment of the population, for such a system, I insist personally as a

With regard to this point, if the populations of the Portuguese Empire were, as is alleged, only in a position of suffrage, then they would all be represented on a basis of equality in the Portuguese Parliament, but as it is there are three members, or some small number of members, in the Portuguese Parliament representing all these people on an extremely limited franchise.

Nothing whatever in the Charter authorizes the United Nations to contradict the existence of a unitary State, irrespective of the geographical position of the various components of the national territory. A proof of this is that the United Nations, surely acquainted after ten years with the terms of the Portuguese Constitution, has not found in that Constitution any provision which would jeopardize the admittance of Portugal into this Organization. Thus, the very fact that Portugal was unanimously admitted to membership in the United Nations signifies beyond any possible doubt respect for a political and constitutional structure, a structure which is centuries older than the existence of the United Nations.#

> 33.	In fact, the present political Constitution of the Republic of Portugal, enacted in 1933, followed the unalterable tradition of the Portuguese constitutional laws which had their origin in the fifteenth century. It defines in Article I the national territory as an indivisible unity, placing all its conduct on a plane of equality. Manifestly, it is not a new juridical conception nor a simple gesture of political expediency: it is, on the contrary, the very essence of a nation which was born, grew and defined itself very long ago in several continents, unhindered by distinction of race, religion, social origins or castes. This unitary political structure, embodied in the fundamental laws of the country—thus much older than the movements of modern constitutionalism— was later expressed in all the Portuguese constitutional texts, namely the constitutions of 1822, 1832, 1842 and 1911, whence it took its present shape. Even the latest reform of ,the Portuguese constitution— which no one has suggested
altered its substance- well antedates the 1 admittance of Portugal into the United Nations.#

As a final result of these realities, the sovereignty of the Portuguese nation is one and indivisible, and it cannot therefore acknowledge any specific international status which would differentiate between parts of the same national territory. These facts render absolutely impossible the applicability of Chapter XI of the Charter to Portugal, for it would imply the imposition of a distinct international status to one or another part of the national territory. Such a status would have to be then the one applicable to Non-Self-Governing Territories, which is strictly prohibited by the constitutional structure of Portugal, for it is clearly defined that all parts of the national territory, and their respective populations, are independent with the ’ independence of the nation. We could not discriminate against a segment of the population, for such a system would bear a racial discrimination which we have never practised during eight centuries of nationhood.#

We believe that the fundamental rights, and even the very existence of a small nation, and of. a small people—the people of Tibet—are threatened. We believe that whenever the rights of a small people are forcibly violated in this manner, the representatives of other small peoples in this Assembly have the duty to speak out.

There are actions which in themselves are repugnant to the moral conscience of mankind. The best and speediest way of ending the cold war is to refrain from such actions and to pursue peaceful policies; indeed, that course was recommended by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, His Excellency, Nikita S.

The first is that, whatever may have been said not only by the Heads of State but by the representatives of Ghana and the Soviet Union, the ineradicable fact remains that it was Belgium which led the Congo to independence and which recognized its sovereignty on 30 June I960, without conditions, time-limits or reservations of any kind. It did so after eighteen months of preparation and on the basis of a round fable conference at which it held discussions on a footing of equality with the legitimate representatives of the Congo, and after free general elections with secret ballot. I can only wish that the Prime Minister of the Soviet Union might draw inspiration from this example and apply it in certain areas controlled by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.#
Error: unexpected symbol in "318.    The"#
> 319.	My second observation is this. Since our position before 30 June was only too obvious, the attempt is being made to implicate us in what happened after 30 June in an independent State. The criticism is absurd because it would imply both naivete and cruelty on our part. Naivete because why, I would ask, should we have given immediate and unconditional independence to the Congo if we wished to take it back somewhat later in far more difficult circumstances. So much for naivete. I appeal to this Assembly, however, to understand the cruelty implied by this criticism. We left in the Congo, after 30 June, more than 80,000 of our nationals, and of those 80,000 nationals more than half were women and children. This means that those who say we granted independence to the Congo out of a kind of Machiavellianism are also accusing us of haying held cheap the honour of our women and the lives of our children.#

We did this, and I wonder who among you would not now despise us if we had not done it. Above and beyond all legal arguments, human feelings mean something, after all.

There are many peoples newly represented among us. How can they be expected to have confidence in this international Organization if they see that a medium-sized power like Belgium, which has done its best to apply the principles of the United Nations Charter, can be unjustly slandered in this way without being defended, without being supported by the majority among you? And how can they have confidence in the Organization they are entering, how can they believe in peaceful coexistence, how can they believe in the achievement of disarmament and world peace, if the policies advocated by some in no way reflect a desire for impartiality, justice and peace, but rather a partisan desire to advance certain special interests.#

> 122.	I come to this rostrum with the confidence of truth and the serenity of justice; passion and emotion I leave entirely to others. In 1942, almost twenty years ago, my country signed with Ecuador a Protocol of Peace, Friendship and Boundaries designed to Settle an old frontier question—a very complicated question, but one in which there was one overwhelming reality in Peru’s favour: its sovereignty over and possession of the Amazon basin, which has had links with Peru since the latter’s discovery—that is to Say, since the Inca empire. Peru signed this Protocol after there had been border incidents provoked by Ecuador. This is a matter of established fact, and my country will have the documents circulated everywhere, even though it is not necessary to do so, there being a guaranteed treaty in force between Peru and Ecuador. These border incidents took place in violation of the status quo existing between Peru and Ecuador. 123.	Peru, which is a peaceable country, which has committed no aggression
against any country, which has a tradition of Pan-Americanism; Peru, which in 1847 convened a congress to defend Ecuador against a possible act of aggression from outside the continent; Peru, which in 1853 defended Central America; Peru, which in 1860 defended the Dominican Republic and protested against European intervention in Mexico; Peru, which was the first in America to recognize the belligerency of Cuba; Peru could not commit aggression against any country. All it did was defend itself; and of course, in repelling aggression, its forces advanced and a peace treaty had to be signed. It goes without saying that Peru did not keep an inch of the territory its advance had covered. Why should the territory Which was the theatre of the unexceptionable military operations Peru was compelled to carry out be willfully confused with the Amazon basin, which was Peru’s possession? 124.	And now I am going to relate, not an adventure story, but the true story of this affair. As you know, Pizarro had a successor,
his brother, Gonzalo, Gonzalo wished to discover El Dorado, and from Cuzco organized an expedition, which, after traversing all the various parts of Peru, found on arriving at Quito that the best route at that time, and the easiest, was the Napo river. A lieutenant of Pizarro, the Governor of Peru, discovered the Amazon. How can it be said that Ecuador, which did not even exist (for Ecuador did not exist in 1539) discover the Amazon? There are some things which cannot be said, even in the tolerant forum of the United Nations. 125.	The Viceroyalty of Peru sent its Governors, Diego de Vaca and Martin de la Riva Herrera, and established the Missions. The fact that for a mere sixty years, from 1740 to 1802, these Missions were under the jurisdiction of the Viceroyalty of Santa F6 did not deprive the King of Spain of the right to change a doubtful boundary line.#

Ecuador was then not even in existence; there was a State of Gran Colombia. And the Constitution of 1823 was ratified by the people of Maynas and not the Constitution alone, but the principles of 1822. Representatives of Maynas always attended the Peruvian congresses; they took part in the Congresses of 1827, 1828 and 1832; they swore loyalty to the permanent Constitution; and Bolivar, as ruler of Peru, governed Maynas as Peruvian territory, and Jan as well, despite the fact that Jan still remained attached to the Viceroyalty of Santa Fe; however, of its own free choice it continued to be part of Peru, and Bolivar said: "I respect Jan’s decision".#

The Peruvian Amazon was not only discovered by a lieutenant of Pizarro, with Peruvian money and an expedition organized by Peru, but was also exploited by Peru. It was the scene of the achievements of men like Salinas, Vaca, Martin de la Rosa, Herrera, and Francisco Requena. And later, when free navigation was established under the Treaty with Brazil, a population was settled there, a population which today probably amounts to 500,000 inhabitants. The capital, Iquitos, has 140,000 inhabitants. I ask you: What populations did Ecuador settle in the Amazon basin? The Protocol of Peace, Friendship and Boundaries signed at Rio de Janeiro in 1942 did not take a single city from Ecuador. The Protocol of Rio de Janeiro did not make any Ecuadorian citizen change his nationality. Whatever there is on the frontier, whatever has been achieved in the Amazon region, is the work of Peru
, and all that the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro did was to sanction the sovereignty and the long-established possession of Pent.

Mr. Velasco Ibarra, President of Ecuador, has said, in documents which Peru has circulated, that he will recognize the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro; that he does not ask for a revision of the Protocol. Only now- doubtless because of certain electoral campaign promises—has this explosion occurred, after an interval of almost twenty years, against a Treaty executed with the co-operation of the United States of America, Argentina, Brazil and Chile. All the posts have been set up, and marks have been put in place over a distance of 1,600 kilometres; only a short distance of seventy-eight kilometres remains to be demarcated. So this is a treaty which has been put into effect and carried out, and it is a treaty which reflects historical, legal and political realities in America.#

Moreover, the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro granted it other territories, a fact which it has forgotten to mention. The Protocol recognized as belonging to Ecuador the territories of the upper river basin, to which Peru might have laid claim under the Decree of 1802, and the Protocol does not debar Ecuador from traffic on the Amazon river; it authorizes such traffic in the broadest form permitted by international law.#

All that Peru asks is that the treaty should be carried out; all it wishes is that the demarcation of the boundary should be completed, that the international personality with which it attained independence, and the work of the liberators, the work of that army which freed Maynas, the work of liberation which Bolivar respected, should continue to be respected.#

I regret that my previous statement of Ecuador's position should have prompted the Peruvian representative's vehement outburst. He saw fit to reply to the legal arguments and hard facts adduced by the Ecuadorian delegation with a Peruvian romance, a Peruvian Arabian Nights’ tale, which must surely have astonished those who are familiar with Latin American history and who know that the Ecuadorian delegation, in coming to this rostrum, did not seek to falsify the truth but spoke on the basis of facts and figures.#

Secondly, the Peruvian representative confirmed the obvious fact that the so-called Protocol of Peace, Friendship and Boundaries of 1942 was signed at a time when Peruvian troops were occupying extensive provinces of Ecuador. In other words, he brought out what the Ecuadorian delegation has maintained and asserted, namely, that the Protocol was a direct result of force, aggression, coercion and pressure. These facts have been confirmed for us by the Peruvian representative and I therefore express my gratitude to him because the Assembly has learned from his own lips that Ecuador was attacked and that, having been attacked and having its territory occupied, it was forced to sign the so-called Protocol of Peace, Friendship and Boundaries.#

The truth is that I am a modern historian, referring only to a Treaty of 1829, whereas he sought to go even further back, to the sixteenth century. What surprises me, however, is that he denied the existence of the 1829 Treaty, which was recognized by Peruvian authorities like Arturo Garcia and Pardo y Larrera, while Mr. Belaunde himself in the allegations he made in Washington in 1938—not against the validity but against the present applicability of the 1829 Treaty—recognized the existence of this Treaty.

Hence, whatever may be the reply of the Peruvian representative, Ecuador will not take the floor again. The case is already known to all. Why should we insist? We were compelled to sign a treaty, a treaty which was not one of peace, friendship, boundaries.

In Ecuador it was announced everywhere that this frontier incident was to conclude with an Ecuadorian victory and that Ecuadorian troops were advancing over Peruvian territory.

Control over armaments means recognizing that we must continue to have armaments even in the future. But it is obvious that, if armaments persist, at a critical moment all those who possess weapons will, voluntarily or involuntarily, reach for the holster, reach for these weapons. At a critical moment those who have weapons and adhere to a position-of-strength policy will not ask the Security Council or call the General Assembly to discuss whether or not they should use these weapons; they will simply use them.

But in that case the taking of one-man decisions with regard to one operation or another will depend on the moral convictions, on the conscious of the Secretary-General. Is it really permissible for the fate of millions to be dependent on the action of the one man occupying that post? We cannot rely on the conscience of the Secretary-General, for each of us has his own idea of conscience, his own under standing of ethics. The capitalist world has its own code of ethics, the communist world another, and/ neutral countries a third. 49.

I should like, however, once again to state that the assets of Belgium were kept completely separate from those of its former colony. There were two distinct currencies; there was a Belgian franc and there was a Congolese franc. There were separate reserves of gold and of foreign exchange. Finally, the companies which had been granted the right to mine the ores that everyone is talking about today were required, under our legislation, to assign to the Congolese authorities, at that time the Government-General of the Congo, a large proportion of the shares which they issued. The amount varied, depending on the terms of the concession, but it amounted in some cases—in fact almost always—to not less than 25 per cent and sometimes rose to more than 50 per cent. That portfolio was the property of the colony; it has
been transmitted intact to the Republic of the Congo, to which it belongs today. It is currently valued at from $600 to $800 million.#

Why? For what purpose? To keep it? To take it back? Surely it would have been much simpler not to have granted the Congo its independence at all We are not as illogical as that.

Patrice Lumumba has also been accused of being a communist. But this convenient label—which does not frighten us in the least—is being used hypocritically to cover the reluctance to admit and to accept that Cuba has asserted its independence and has left the sphere of the political, economic, diplomatic and military interests of United States imperialism, that Cuba is not now allowing itself, like Guatemala, to be used as a spearhead for United States designs against the territorial integrity, national self-deter

This last assertion is in fact conclusive: a confession made by one party renders further evidence unnecessary. Although whatever is attributed to the Cuban Government in this delirious communique is absolutely false, there is no doubt that the Guatemalan Government has declared its willingness to accept foreign military bases on its national territory. The mere willingness in this case is already extremely serio

We Guatemalans have heard quite enough about the so-called "case of Guatemala", a phrase which seeks to convey the idea that our country has been the victim of aggression by a Power on this Continent. This, as our Foreign Minister has emphatically stated [874th meeting], Is absolutely false. It was the people of Guatemala who, tired of the continual violation of Its freedom and of the massacres of the people perpetrated by the communist hordes of Arbenz Guzman, the present protege of the Castro regime, in June 1954 waged the battle of liberation which overthrew that Government. No foreigners intervened in the liberation of my country, and Castro's followers know this very well, because, when the liberation movement was in preparation in 1953, the so-called Spanish Republican General Alberto Bayo offered us his pamphlet on the Republican guerrillas, which we refused because we wanted no foreign interference. Great was our surprise to learn that the instructions in these pamphlets were being used by th

The Cuban representative says he is not surprised that from time to time we accuse his Government of attempting to subvert the internal order of Guatemala; he shrugs this off by saylng that the alarm clock will ring at the hour for which it is set. Indeed, Mr. Roa, that clock is being set by the present Cuban Government in its constant attempts at aggression, and on each occasion it sounds the alarm of my country. I have here a cable commenting on the report in the daily newspaper Revolucidn, the organ of Castro's 26th of July Movement, which fully confirms the fact that an armed schooner, La Cubans, was observed off the coast of Guatemala and fled under the machine- gun fire of our air force. It further confirms that the schooner was obliged to douse its lights and hastily make for the Mexican coast, but that It ran aground at Cozumel. I am reminded of the legal axiom used by Mr. Roa: "If one party confesses, no evidence is needed." There is only one small discrepancy between the version given by th
e official Cuban newspaper and the charge levelled by my country: while we assert that the vessel was attempting to land a cargo of arms, the Cuban Government wishes us to believe that, although the extremely rich fishing grounds off the coasts of Campeche and Yucatan, in Mexico, lie less than 200 miles from Cuban territory, the Cuban vessel made a very lengthy voyage of more than 500 miles in order to arrive at the exceedingly poor fishing grounds off the Atlantic coast of Guatemala.#

It was a war that started with terror by Israel in 1940 and which ended in the creation of Israel in 1948. The Jewish armies were not virtually unarmed, as claimed, as phrased, as eloquently worded by Mrs. Meir. They were armed to the teeth, and their tactics were pillage, plunder, destruction and extermination.#

During the course of the Second World War when the United Kingdom was engaged in a war of life and death, it was Mr. Ben Gurion who declared war as follows—and these are the words of the Prime Minister of the lady who comes from Israel: We shall fight our war as if there were no war."#

Mr. Ben Gurion did not make his challenge through political pronouncements; it was a challenge of war.

Through Jewish immigration under United Kingdom bayonets, the Jews of Palestine had risen from 50,000 in 1919 to 750,000 in 1948. This is an alien infiltration of masses who have never known the country—owned nothing, possessed nothing, neither themselves, nor their forbears, should they be able to trace their ancestry three thousand years old. As a little illustration, let me assure you that each and every member of the Israel delegation now seated in the Assembly, including the lady from Israel, are not, and have never been citizens of Palestine. But they find enough courage to challenge the right of the citizens of Palestine to go back to their home, their ancestral home, their immemorial home.#

On these mountains and in these valleys they built their towns and villages; they planted their vineyards and orchards; they established their farms and factories; they constructed their mosques and churches; they gently and peacefully dug their graves. This is what makes a homeland dear, sacred and deserving of every honourable sacrifice.

Members of the General Assembly will no doubt have noticed that, in the three verbal exchanges which we have had with the Guatemalan delegation, my delegation has confined itself to exercising its right of reply.

What is it that makes it see ghosts everywhere and robs it of slumber, producing instead a delirious waking state, in which it sees the vengeance of the people in the phantom figure of Jacobo Arbenz, and expeditions leaving Cuba which never materialize and which, of course, never reach their destination? First, at the 874th meeting on 27 September last, the representative of Guatemala spoke of 2,000 soldiers who were being trained in the Province of Camaguey with a view to invading Guatemala. I denied the fantastic statement, and repeated to this Assembly that the Revolutionary Government of Cuba has said again and again that it is unshakably attached to the principle of non-intervention. I added, without ironical intention: "The representative of Guatemala may rest assured—there are no 2,000 soldiers being trained in Camaguey for an invasion of Guatemala."#

> 181.	There was no more talk by the delegation of Guatemala about the 2,000 soldiers in training in Camaguey, and we were happy to have been able to calm the Guatemalan delegation. But The New York Times of 4 October last carried a report that a schooner, flying no flag, and named "La Cubana", had been sighted in Guatemalan territorial waters off the Atlantic coast. According to the report in The New York Times—and the information of the Guatemalan Government goes no further than what is contained in that report—the airforce obliged the schooner to withdraw from territorial waters, and it was seen on the following day near the island of Cotzumel, listing to port. We are not surprised that this incident inflamed the sensitive Guatemalan imagination. It was immediately said that the schooner was carrying arms and that its arrival was being awaited by the communists. Another version by the Guatemalan Government was that the schooner constituted the vanguard of a fleet organized for the purpose of invading
Guatemala and overthrowing its Government. We are truly sorry to have to trouble the General Assembly in connexion with this further complaint by Guatemala, but it is necessary to inquire seriously into the substance of this episode. If the schooner was carrying arms, where are the arms? If the schooner was the vanguard of a fleet, where are the other units of the fleet? A quantity of contraband heroin can be hidden in a few suitcases, as was done recently by a Guatemalan diplomat and as was discovered in this city, but a shipment of contraband arms cannot be so easily concealed. As for the fleet, we must suppose that it was swallowed up by the Caribbean, in a spirit of righteous indignation.#

Is there no limit to the feverish Guatemalan imagination?

The present Government of Guatemala, made to the measure of the United States State Department and for its use and convenience. is reduced to the wretched role of a tool of United States policy. Guatemala is afraid, but that is not all. The Guatemalan manoeuvre is a smokescreen to cover the intention of attacking the Revolutionary Government of Cuba. The ridiculous Guatemalan accusations against our Government are meant to serve as a bridge for the State Department in an attempt to crush the Cuban Revolution. That intention was denounced by Mr. Roa in his reply on 7 October, which I now confirm in full. It is said that there will be an attack from Cuba, because what is really being planned is an attack on Cuba. The expedition which landed near Baracoa and was destroyed a few days ago and the counter-revolutionary force which was defeated in the region of Escambray confirm our assertion. But the attempts will not stop th
ere, as future events will show. Cuba will be not the attacker, but the attacked. We are well aware of that, but unlike Guatemala, we do not lose any sleep over it. We calmly await the enemies within and without who intend to destroy us, secure in the knowledge that we shall triumph.#

What is most annoying to the Ydfgoras Government is the fact that the Revolutionary Government of Cuba has given asylum to Jacobo Arbenz, the deposed President of Guatemala, But did not Uruguay first offer him such asylum? Such hospitality is not contrary to, nor does it weaken, Cuba's adherence to the principle of non intervention. That is clear, positive and final. How is it possible for our Government to participate in expeditionary plans, or in interference in other countries, at the very time when intervention in our own country is tragically imminent? Revolutions, we repeat, are not for export. Their moral repercussions, their example, are another matter—the example of a generation which grew beards in sign of responsibility in beardless times of conformity and petty interests.

The Castro Government is the product of a revolutionary movement which has succeeded and could only have succeeded because it could rely on the absolute support of the people. lt was said that no insurrectionary movement could prevail against a professional army, but Castro destroyed that myth because he had the support of the people. It was also said that no Latin American Government could exist which opposed the designs and dictates of the United States Government; Fidel Castro is destroying that myth also. All this is possible because Fidel Castro has the people behind him. How can it be said that a government which is transforming barracks into schools is maintained by bayonets? Its essentially democratic nature is confirmed by its frequent consultations of the people. Never before has the Cuban people participated so directly in the decisions of the Government. It is no longer an indifferent spectator, but an enthusiastic actor. To
the terms of the Declaration of Havana and to Lincoln's definition of democracy—government of the people, by the people and for the people—nothing remains to be added.

> 189.	From the beginning of the nineteenth century when the first separatist movement appeared, Cuba was a victim of the ambitions of the United States, Britain and France. The European designs for a time frustrated the plans of the United States, which then preferred to maintain the status quo of a Spanish Cuba. From 1809 for almost a century, Cubans struggled by means of plots, rebellions and wars. It eventually became the policy of the United States to obtain Cuba by purchase or annexation. While the other Spanish colonies in America were becoming independent, our independence was delayed as a consequence of foreign ambitions which prevented Cuba from achieving its destiny. Pro-slavery interests and empty hopes of palliative reforms by the absolutist Spanish colonial regime also retarded our independence movement. The Cubans finally came to their great wars of independence, those of 1868-1878 and 1895-1898. When the first war, the so-called ten years war, ended, as our Enrique Jose Varona observes, "the
Cuban had lost economic supremacy and had not attained political power. It is true that this phrase refers especially to the slave-holding land-owners, but it admirably expresses the fundamental difference between the revolutions of 1868 and 1895. In 1895, the Cubans were fighting to obtain political independence, but they had already lost economic control. The revolution preached and directed by Jose Marti came from the masses, from the humble people, and its main resources were the modest contributions of the Cuban tobacco growers of Tampa and Key West, and of the lower classes, rather than the Cuban aristocracy, which had been for the most part ruined by the previous war.#

Although the first war of independence ended in the treaty of Zanj6n, which was nothing more, and could be nothing more, than a truce between Cuba and Spain, the great General Antonio Maceo reaffirmed in the Mangos de Baragus. protest that between Cuba and Spain there could be no conciliation or compromise, but only one answer, national independence. During that period there was no change in the trend of United States policy towards Cuba. The United States still preferred a North American Cuba and failing that, a Spanish Cuba, but never a European Cuba, having earlier, for its own purposes and convenience, produced the so-called Monroe Doctrine, which, by the way, had been proposed in August 1823 by Lord Canning, the British Prime Minister. The Monroe Doctrine is a unilateral declaration establishing a form of protectionism which encroaches on the sovereignty of the Latin American Republics, which have never given their consent
to it, and it is today without effect and serves no purpose.#

> 191.	When victory for the Cuban forces in the last war of independence was already in sight, the Government of the United States, which no longer saw the possibility of purchase or annexation, took advantage of the controversial incident of the sinking of the "Maine" to obtain from Congress the joint resolution of 19 April 1898, to proclaim that Cuba was, and by right should be, free and independent, and to intervene in the war between Cuba and Spain. The Cuban people has always recognized the generous sentiments of the people of the United States, which must not be corn- fused with the intentions and aims of their Government. But that is one thing, and It would be quite a different thing to concede that one of the peoples which have fought hardest for independence owes its independence entirely to the assistance of a. third party. What is unacceptable to Cuban sentiment is that the noble purposes proclaimed in the joint resolution were followed by the refusal to allow the Cuban troops of General Calixto
Garcia to make a victorious entry into Santiago de Cuba or to give Cuba a place at the Paris Conference where the treaty of peace with Spain was discussed, and, above all, by the imposition of the Platt amendment, which limited our independence.#

> 192.	This entire historical process sheds much light on what Cuba is today. We attained political independence on obviously limited terms. Since we did not have economic power, we ceased to be a colony of Spain only to become a colony of the United States. Until the time of the revolution against the tyranny of Machado, apart from a few prophetic voices of illustrious compatriots, the atmosphere we lived in was one of corruption and intrigue. The revolutionary struggle against that tyranny started us on the road to our goals. We had to obtain control of the economy to win full enjoyment of political independence, to attain historical independence in the fullest sense. Many of these ideas and aspirations were incorporated in the Constitution of 1940, but many were left unfulfilled. In fact, more was promised than given. The new generation—the generation of Moncada—was faced not only with the task of overthrowing the tyranny of Batista—that was the easiest task, in spite of its heroic dimensions—but
also with that of changing historical reality, and of transforming a colony into a republic. To complete that historic undertaking, to make the leap over half a century of almost sterile republican existence, is the purpose of the revolutionary operation which is now being carried out.#

Thus at the time of the resolution the Arabs constituted more than two-thirds of the population, while the Jews constituted only less than one-third. Jewish land ownership hadby then increased to 5 1/2 per cent of the total^area.

Great sympathy was always shown towards Jews who were persecuted in other parts of the world, and whenever some of them came to Palestine, or to other Arab areas, they were given asylum, and were received with generous welcome and goodwill. Even as late as the Second World War, when the present ruler of Arab Morocco, which had then fallen under Nazi influence and domination, was asked to isolate Jews he very nobly and emphatically refused to do so, answering that all Moroccan citizens must continue to be treated alike. In spite of such a magnanimous attitude and treatment however, Zionists, by false and persistent propaganda, eventually succeeded in deceiving many Jew

Perhaps the saddest aspect of the tragedy, however, is that this very elementary but grave act of aggression and injustice is not recognized as such by an intelligent group of people like the Jews, who have good reason to be proud of their history, of their Bible, and of their ethics. Hence they ask the question: "What is the error?" This blindness to error and injustice is the root of the whole problem of Palestine. As long as such an attitude is maintained, as long as "wrong" is called "right", and as long as the rights and welfare of a million human beings are sacrificed for the political ends of others, no solution will be found to the Palestine problem, and no real peace can consequently be established in the Middle East.#

[897th meeting, para. 162.] How untrue and sanctimonious this statement is.

First, Jews came into Palestine, after the First World War, under the protection of British military forces; secondly, the main argument which Zionist leaders used to convince the British Government to support actively the establishment of a Zionist State in Arab Palestine was that such a State could be used as a base for protecting the route to the Far East, an important artery in British communications. This became abundantly clear during the tripartite aggression on Egypt, in which the British, the French and Israel took part. The role played by Israel then was the one which had been set for it even before it had been born. Thirdly, Israel is not a self-supporting country, and lives mainly on alms and charity. At the same time Israel goes about lending huge sums of money to certain under-developed countries. Where does this money come from? Why is Israel chosen as an intermediary between those who
provide the capital and those who need it? Can we not discern the hand of imperialism in disguise? Let those to whom Israel makes such offers be exceedingly careful, the more so when the offers appear to be generous.#

Hearing the claims of Mrs. Meir one would imagine that Israel has been so generous and gracious as to house and give employment to these Arabs. The Arabs who are now in Israel are a section of the real owners of the country. They own lands, houses and other properties, most of which have been usurped to give housing and employment to Jewish immigrants from abroad. Thus the Arabs in Israel do not live because of the generosity and gracious ness of Israel, but they live in spite of the persecution and ill-treatment which they receive at the hand of Israel. It may be of interest to this Assembly to be informed of some of the forms taken by that ill-treatment and persecution: first, expropriation of property in order to make room for additional Jewish immigrants; secondly, restriction of movement for the Arab individual; thirdly, compulsory sale to the Government of Arab crops at prices lower than those paid to Jewish cultivators; fourt

I have here before me the text of a British Command Paper, No. 6873, of July 1946, about twenty months before the happenings under discussion. It gives what it calls conservative figures relating to the three Jewish illegal para-military organizations in Palestine—the Haganah, the Palmach and the Irgun Zvai Leumi.

[897th meeting, para. 154.] This is not the first time that we hear such wild claims. The tone even suggests that the desert did bloom 2,000 years ago when they were there, and stopped blooming only during the period of Jewish exile. How absurd! Here are the plain facts for any one who. cares to verify them. Palestine was known as the land of milk and honey long before the Jews had any contact with it, and when the Jews first arrived there, they were astounded at the, large-sized bunches of grapes which the country produced.

The country was being developed gradually by its own inhabitants for their own benefit as fast as development was needed. The so-called Judaean hills—and I come from them- were covered with fruit trees, mainly olives and grapes, which were all planted by Arabs. Certain areas had not yet been developed. This was only natural. Such was the situation at the end of the First World War, and not as the Israelis would have you believe.#

Naturally, with more people and more money it was possible to develop the country faster. But what was the result? The country stopped being self-supporting .and has not been so since. Huge sums of money have been poured into Israel every year, and huge sums will have to continue to be poured in, simply because the whole operation is uneconomic and unnatural.

Do they seriously mean to convince us and the world that in order to develop Palestine there was no alternative but to create a Jewish State there, attended by cruel massacres, by the continuous suffering of a million people, by racial hatred, and by the loss of international peace and goodwill? Is it not like burning a house in order to find a penny? Or, conversely, do they mean to tell us that the object of the Jews in creating their State was to develop Palestine? As a child who studied the Bible, I was always taught that the Jews had a unique and noble role in history, to produce prophets and ethical principles. Is it not a great pity that they should now come down to the level of feeling proud and praiseworthy of their success in producing potatoes instead?

So far they have refused to do so ..." [Ibid., para. 164.] I regret to say that this statement is not true, hi 1949, Arab and Israel delegates went to Lausanne. A certain agreement was reached and was signed by the parties concerned on 12 May 1949. This was the well-known Protocol of Lausanne. The following day, however, the Israel delegates withdrew their signatures. It was discovered later that in Lausanne they had been merely manoeuvering for admission to the United Nations.

> 44.	One of the most perturbing factors of the Palestine problem is the continuous extension of aggression on Arab rights which is being carried out mainly in three ways. The first is continuing Jewish immigration into Israel, in spite of the fact that Israel is not self- supporting. This additional Jewish immigration is used as a pretext to block the return of Arab refugees to their properties and their homes, thus rendering the solution of the problem more difficult. The second is the expropriation of the properties of the Arabs, even those who are in Israel, as I mentioned before. The third is the plans and efforts to divert part of the waters of the Jordan river for the benefit of immigrants. My country, the Kingdom of Jordan, is badly in need of every drop of water in the Jordan River for its present and future inhabitants. Although these waters are not fully utilized at present, because of lack of funds, our very existence demands that they be fully used for our benefit in the future. We depend mainl
y on rain water, and for the last few years, our people have been short even of drinking water. Is it reasonable for us, therefore, to allow even a part of the waters of the River Jordan to be diverted for the benefit of newly arrived foreigners and strangers while our sons and daughters go thirsty for lack of water? This additional aggression will eventually exhaust the patience of the most peaceful human beings.#

But God forbid that the Jewish people—like every other people in the world, like the ten and more Arab countries who have all become independent since the First World War—that the Jewish people too should have a piece of soil under their feet in order that they may grow potatoes for their profit and for themselves. The poet laureate of the Jewish people said that the space of sky above the head of a people is only as large as the soil under its feet. Only when
people are rooted in their soil— and raising potatoes is nothing to be ashamed of—only when they have roots deep in their soil, only then can their culture and prophecy also flourish.#

I do not think that I should now take up the time of tills Assembly to argue with the Foreign Minister of the Union about this matter.

If the Foreign Minister reads some recent history, he will find that no force of oppression, however great and cruel, and no despotism, however long-lived, can save the antiquated colonial regime in his country, a regime which is trying to perpetuate a system of exploitation of the native human and material resources for the benefit of the few. The world cannot remain indifferent to this inhumane policy followed, in respect to the native population, by the South African Government, and however hard they try to twist or distort the genuine efforts o* other countries in their march towards progress and justice, they certainly cannot prevent honest people from seeing and condemning the colonial oppression practised by that Government.#

We invite Mr. Louw to come to Iraq to witness for himself the material and cultural development we have been able to achieve in recent years, the way we are preparing our people to exercise and enjoy democratic living, and above all to see how people of different races, beliefs and professions are treated equally in all fields of social and political life. We are marching with the current of history and we are bound to succeed. The ruling classes in South Africa are marching against the current, and the great wheel of history is bound to crush them sooner or later. In the last analysis, revolution is perhaps the only way for the colonial peoples to achieve their justice at this juncture in the history of colonialism. Justice is a power: if it cannot construct, it can at least destroy. So the question which we should be asking is not whether there will be a revolution, but whether it will be beneficial or disastrous.#

> 206.	Mr. HERRARTE (Guatemala) (translated from Spanish): In his speech on Tuesday, 27 September 1960 [874Sh meeting], the Guatemalan Minister for Foreign Affairs complained from this rostrum of the threats of certain elements, sponsored by the Cuban Government, to invade Guatemala. Later , at the same meeting, exercising the right of reply, the Cuban delegation gave assurances that Cuba was not intervening and would not intervene in the domestic affairs of other States.207.	Nevertheless, on the instructions of my Government, I have come before the Assembly to repeat the charge. On the night of 1 October 1960, a frigate flying no flag but bearing the name La Cubana, was sighted in Guatemalan territorial waters, on the Atlantic side and refused to respond to orders to halt for inspection by the port; authorities of Matfas de Galvez. According to reports received by my Government, the frigate was expected by communist elements in contact with the present Cuban Government, and was using the darkness of the n
ight to reach the Guatemalan coast. The Guatemalan Air Force compelled it to withdraw from territorial waters and on the following day it was sighted close to the island of Cozumel, listing to port. This news item was sent out by the Press cable agencies and was published in The New York Times, though not in full on 4 October.208.	I should observe that this landing was synchronized with certain disturbances which took place on the morning of 2 October in the capital of Guatemala at the instigation of communist leaders acting on flimsy pretexts.209.	The Guatemalan Government, through the General Assembly, wishes to protest most energetically against these further instances of interference by the Cuban Government in the domestic political affairs of Guatemala, all of which constitute aggression and are endangering the free institutions of Guatemala.211.	Mr. SOEBANDRIO (Indonesia): Knowing well the pressure of time and work upon this session of the General Assembly, it is with some reluctance that I have re
quested the right of reply to the statement made yesterday [886th meeting! by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands: The issues raised are so grave that they must be clarified.212.	The Netherlands Foreign Minister has challenged Indonesia to clarify its position and its statements. I am glad to accept this challenge. However, I wish to leave no illusion in the mind of anyone, least of all in the mind of the Netherlands Foreign Minister. By exercising the right of reply, Indonesia does not retreat from the position expressed last week [880th meeting] by President Sukarno on behalf of the Indonesian Government and people. Indonesia makes no form of apology for the considered words used by our President. Indonesia ha» no intention of acting others- wise than, as explicitly indicated by President Sukarno.213.	The Netherlands Foreign Minister referred to the conflict between the Republic of Indonesia and the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This conflict originated in the fact that the Netherlands st
ill refuses to recognize the complete transfer of sovereignty from the Netherlands East Indies to the independent Republic of Indonesia. It was explicitly agreed that this transfer was to cover the whole territory of the Netherlands East Indies. The Netherlands, a decade later, has still not lived up to this agreement. The conflict began as a political conflict, but during the years it has extended itself, by no fault of ours, to economic matters, and now, unfortunately, and again through no fault of ours, the threat of physical issues is raised.214.	The General Assembly has been told by the representative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands that Indonesia sustains a territorial claim to West Irian. That is not true, Indonesia is not sustaining any territorial claim; we are declaring the right of the Indonesian people to be sovereign and independent within all the territory formerly covered by the Netherlands East Indies. We do not make any claim to any other part of the Indonesian Archipelago. Indonesia exp
licitly does not make any claim at all to territory such as that in Borneo or Timor which lies within the Indonesian Archipelago but was not part of the Netherlands East Indies. We are not sustaining a territorial claim; we are sustaining a national claim, and that national claim is the right of our nation to be united and independent.215.	In 1950, when the Netherlands recognized our sovereignty, it did not whole-heartedly complete the formal transfer, nor has it yet done so. Indeed, in every part of Indonesia the Netherlands left behind the seeds of unrest and disturbance. I would remind the General Assembly of the military disturbances, caused by the Dutch adventurer Westerling. I would also re-mind the General Assembly of the separatist movements, originated or encouraged by the Netherlands, such as what is usually called the Republic of the South Moluccas. There was political, economic and military subversion. This was beyond question instigated and encouraged by those Dutch interests which still sough
t to preserve themselves in our territory and to capitalize on a troubled and turbulent situation. Furthermore, separatism was encouraged not only In the territory of West Irian but also in Java, Sumatra, and other islands.216.	We survived these things, and not only have we survived them, but for the greater part we have eliminated the obstacles to unity and progress left behind by the Netherlands. We have survived, we have eliminated those obstacles and we are growing stronger; and now, anything the Netherlands does against us, be sure that we will meet them on equal terms.217.	I am constantly surprised and amused at the pseudo-scientific arguments advanced concerning alleged ethnological differences between the peoples of West Irian and the peoples of the rest of Indonesia. I am amused by this because during the generations of colonialism the Dutch lost no opportunity of arguing scientifically that all the peoples of the Netherlands East Indies were ethnologically related. Now they are indeed scraping t
he bottom of a, very empty barrel to controvert their own colonial arguments.218.	It is no part of my intention to enter into the ethnological field. The realities of political life are not dependent upon real or alleged ethnological similarities or differences. If that yardstick is to be applied, then I await with impatience the Netherlands intervention to ensure that all peoples who are ethnologically different be disunited.219.	We are not making any new claim. I would point out that in Indonesian history there have been moments of great glory and power, such as during the Kingdoms of Modjapahit and Sriwijaja when our territory ex-tended far beyond our present frontiers. Whenever refer to this, and we have no wish to expand to those frontiers. I mention these facts to indicate that the territory of the Netherlands East Indies was not accidentally delimited.220.	It has become usual that whenever sovereignty is transferred to a new State there is some doubt whether all parts of the territory should belon
g to the new State. Attempts at dismemberment are disguised Tinder various; cloaks, including the cloak of self-determination. I may cite as a recent example of this the situationin the Congo (Leopoldville). We cannot afford more Congos, more West Irians. I may indeed ask whether the representative of the United Kingdom is prepared for this type of disguised dismemberment, bearing in mind the claims of the Scottish and Welsh nationalists. Or, for that matter, is the United States prepared for this—a country which, a hundred years ago, fought a war on this very question? Obviously, this is a ridiculous proposition. By saying this, I just want to show what kind of erratic conclusion we can draw from the logic of the Netherlands Foreign Minister.221.	If the United Nations wishes to apply the right of dismemberment—which is what the Dutch are actually proposing under the cloak of self-determination— then it must be applied to all nations, old and new. Old established and newly established nations must be
measured by the same yardstick.222.	When I speak of applying the same yardstick everywhere, I also cannot refrain from expressing my bewilderment at the exclusive and strangely limited Dutch conception of the right of self-determination. The representative of the Netherlands declared yesterday that Indonesia owed its independent existence to the right of self-determination. I beg to differ. Yes, we exercised the right of self-determination. The whole people of Indonesia exercised this right. But we owe our independent existence to our struggle for national independence. We had to fight for our independent existence because the Dutch refused to recognize the right of self-determination. And what is the record of the Netherlands in other cases? The Netherlands did not support the right of self-determination for the people of Morocco, when that people was struggling for its freedom and submitted its case to the United Nations. The Netherlands did not support in the United Nations the right of the people of T
unisia to self- determination. Yesterday and today, the Netherlands does not support the right of self-determination of th© Algerian people and they, like the people of Indonesia, have to wrest their independent existence through bitter struggle.223. So what is the Dutch conception of the right of self-determination? It is a perversion of that right. It is a denial of that right. It is the indefinite suspension of that right until conditions, according to the Dutch, warrant the exercise of the right of self-determination —that iti, in the never-arriving future. For Indonesia, the right of self-determination meant, according to the Netherlands, after hundreds of years. But we did not wait hundreds of years. The whole people of Indonesia have exercised their right of self-determination, and that right cannot be negated now..224. What about the Netherlands allegiance to the principles of the United Nations? I would not raise this issue except for the fact that the Netherlands Foreign Minister declared yes
terday that the President of Indonesia had, in his address before this body, threatened to act in a manner contrary to the principles of the United Nations, thereby undermining its authority and jeopardizing the peace,225.	I believe that I can say, without any contradiction from anyone, that Indonesia has never acted or threatened to act contrary to the principles of the United Nations. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the Netherlands. It was the Netherlands which committed an act of aggression against Indonesia, in open defiance of the Security Council. This did not occur so long ago. Certainly, it did not occur so long ago that sensible persons would find it to difficult to conceive of the Netherlands harbouring any idea of aggressive intentions towards Indonesia. The Netherlands Foreign Minister said yesterday that this was fantastic. It was perhaps equally fantastic some years ago, but it happened nevertheless. It is hardly for the Netherlands, which has once defied the United Nations, whic
h continues to refuse to be guided by the United Nations principle of negotiation, to accuse any country  including Indonesia, of acting contrary to the principles of the United Nations.226.	Apart from that, what then is the basic threat to peace? In our world, there is today a sustained, irreversible and world-wide drive of peoples and nations to satisfy their basic demands to grow as free, prosperous entities. Opposed to this drive there is colonialism. It is this opposition, it is this colonialism which creates the threat to peace. This is obviously So in Algeria, for example, and equally obviously so in West Irian. The existence of colonialism in West Irian presents a threat to peace. Whether' his threat comes in terms of physical conflict is immaterial. It, is a conflict in the hearts and minds of men, and this is the basic threat toward peace.-aA227.	Since 1950, as President Sukarno pointed out, we have tried bilateral negotiations and negotiations within the United Nations. We continued and perse
vered with these negotiations even when Netherlands subversion within our country was rampant in the economic, military and political fields. We continued the negotiations, with tolerance and hope. We sought to persuade the Netherlands into a lasting friendship and co-operation with Indonesia, But it could come about only If the Netherlands recognised the complete territorial independence of Indonesia. Unfortunately we failed. We foundered on the rock of Dutch colonial intransigence. We were left with no alternative. We had to take other ways to protect our own interests, to reunite our territory, to outlive Netherlands subversion and to eliminate all the obstacles put in out path by reactionary Netherlands colonial interests. 228.	Indeed, we have embarked upon a new course. Now we are .meeting political undermining with political force. We are meeting economic undermining with economic force and we will meet physical force with physical force too. This is a national right which cannot be denied. Do not exp
ect us to sit idly by and accept passively hostile Netherlands activities. Do not expect us passively to await a fate dictated by a remote and unrealistic nation. To do so would perhaps ease the mind of the Netherlands Government, but it would mean the end of Indonesia.229.	I say explicitly that Indonesia is determined to meet force with force in any field. This is not a threat; this is a reality which the Netherlands must accept and which the world must accept. Stubbornness has left us no alternative. Statements issued by the Netherlands offices of publicity before the aircraft carrier Karel Doorman was despatched to Indonesian waters can be interpreted as a semi-declaration of war. What are we to do? Stand idly by? That we will not do. I say again, we will meet force with force and in doing so we are within our rights and within the spirit, of the Charter of the United Nations.230.	Do not think that we are not filled with regret and sorrow that this situation should have arisen. It is not our fault. We
have much to do in our country and it is tragic that so much of our effort and so much of our money must be used in this way. In fact, we, like every nation, cannot afford not to be peaceful. We cannot afford not to struggle for a higher living standard.231.	In his statement yesterday to the General Assembly, the Netherlands Foreign Minister said that the Netherlands administration in West Irian has no other aim than to prepare the population of the Territory, within the shortest possible time, for the exercise of its right of self-determination. He went on to say that it should decide for itself whether it wishes to be an independent country, or to join up with the eastern part of the island, or to become part of Indonesia, or to opt for any other form of political existence.232.	I say clearly that there is no genuine of self-determination contemplated by the Netherlands. The fact is that statements about this are used and misused for the purpose of continuing colonialism. The Netherlands Foreign Ministe
r said that the people may decide to become part of Indonesia. The fact is that they decided to do this, and did it, fifteen years ago.233.	Today, those same people are being subjected to conditioning in order to destroy their right of self- determination, freedom of choice and national unity. I refer the President to a statement made recently by a distinguished member of the Dutch Parliament, Mr. Patijn, who said that the promises made by the Netherlands are so vague that they permit the contemplation of a Dutch colonial empire for another thousand years.234.	I would point out also that the reality of the Dutch administration is not by any means like the picture so lightly sketched by the Netherlands Foreign Minister. I do not intend at this moment to embark upon a discussion about these matters, but I will point out that even the Dutch Parliament has been concerned about the deplorable conditions prevailing in West Irian, A Dutch Parliamentary Mission visited the area last year, and the Dutch administra
tor was dismissed shortly afterwards.235,	Referring now in more general terms to the ideas advanced by the representative of the Netherlands, I must mention the views expressed by him on the word “revolution". It is indeed elementary knowledge that a large part of the world is in a state of revolution. Any politician or statesman who does not recognize the fact that three-quarters of humanity is at this moment in a state of revolution is blind to history. Only a very small minority in the world is stable. We who are involved in revolution are not opposed to those who are stable. But let them not attempt to prevent the revolutionary changes which are taking place. A revolution is not a question of machine guns clattering in the streets. A revolution is not a matter of killing people. A revolution is a period of rapid and radical change and these changes are based upon human consciousness, human desires and human demands. The world-wide revolution of today is a world-wide demand by humanity for equality of
freedom, opportunity, esteem and degree of emancipation. That* is the reality. I am not saying that those who are stable should seek change. That is a question for themselves. I would remind those stable areas, however, that technically advanced thinking does not imply a monopoly of wisdom about the new social, political and economic conceptions required for the development of the majority of mankind. In fact, I am amazed at the ignorance and lack of interest in those matters often displayed in the stable quarter of the world.236,	President Sukarno said that we are not perhaps well versed in technical matters but that we are well versed in matters of social, political and economic conception, and in questions of democracy and the application of democracy. That is very true. We have faced so many problems on those fields that they have become part of our very lives. Our knowledge is not academic but severely practical. If we had not learned how to tackle the manifold problems facing us in those fields, we
should long ago have collapsed. If there is dislocation, commotion and turbulence, there is not chaos. Only too often the imminent collapse of Indonesia has been prophesied by Netherlands organs of publicity, but in fact we have grown stronger.237,	It is a reality that the greatest struggle within the world today is not a conflict of ideology but a conflict between those seeking and demanding rapid revolutionary change and those opposing such change. It is a conflict between those seeking to restore or maintain the image of a glorious past and those seeking the reality of a glorious present and future,238,	Even if there were no ideological conflict within our world, there would still be confrontation on this field. This confrontation does not only apply to international problems but is a problem within nations. However, that conflict between the nations declines as living standards become more level and equalitarian. If a nation such as the Netherlands does not understand" this, that nation will become is
olated. If the views which the statement of Mr. Luns reflects are contrary to reality, then the Netherlands Foreign Minister will be left behind by the new and decisive forces of history.239,	We are proud of solving our problems in a revolutionary way, a revolutionary way which is quickest and best for our people. We are not frustrated but wo are exhilarated by our daily struggle. It has become clear in Indonesia that our problem is not a merely technical problem but is the problem of finding and applying the right concept for every period, however transient that period may be. It is in this field of political, economic and social activity that Indonesia has a genuine contribution to make to the world.240.	I cannot refrain from referring again to the famous statement by George Canning to which the Netherlands Foreign Minister, like President Sukarno, referred. The level of political and ideological confrontation in the Netherlands is such that a political crisis can be caused by a proposal to raise the pr
ice of milk by one cent per pint. This delightfully illustrates the contention first expressed by George Canning. Whilst such matters take up the time and energy of Dutch politicians, they have lost the friendship and harmonious co-operation of Indonesia and bid fair to lose the friendship of all Asia and Africa. Has there ever been such a case of penny wise and pound foolish? We need perhaps a new George Canning to make a new aphorism today.242.	Mr. SCHURMANN (Netherlands): I take it that this is not the occasion to start a discussion about the question of Netherlands New Guinea. Such a discussion has been held no less than four times in the United Nations, and four times in succession the General Assembly has refused to accept the thesis that Indonesia came here to defend. Therefore, I shall not go into all the details of that question and I shall not answer all the points made by the representative of Indonesia. What I wish to do, in just a few words, is to point out a few mistakes and a few things that
were incorrect in what he said.243.	In the first place, he started out by mentioning that when we made the agreement with Indonesia by which Indonesia became independent, it was agreed that we would transfer to Indonesia the whole of the territory that had formerly constituted Netherlands East Indies. The Foreign Minister of Indonesia knows just as well as I do that this is not correct. He knows just af well as I do that there was a treaty, called the Act of Transfer of Sovereignty and Recognitio and that article 2 of that treaty excepted from the transfer to Indonesia the Territory of Netherlands New Guinea with the stipulation that the fate and future of. that Territory would be decided later on, to be precise, within a period of one year.244.	That was one error that I wish to point out. The Second point that was made by the Foreign Minister of Indonesia was that the Indonesian claim was not a territorial claim but, as he put it, that Indonesia sustained the right of the lndonesian people to be united
and independent and that, therefore, Indonesia claimed that the Netherlands should hand over to Indonesia the Territory of Netherlands New Guinea.£5, That argument begs the question because the issue that has kept us divided, and that is still keeping us divided, is, that Indonesia takes it for granted that Netherlands New Guinea is a part of Indonesia and that the population of Netherlands New Guinea wishes  to be a part of Indonesia. But that is exactly the point ] on which we beg to differ because, when Indonesia says that it has already exercised our right of self- 1 determination and the people of Netherlands New Guinea have already exercised that right, what they actually mean is that, when President Sukarno declared the independence of Indonesia in a statement which was j made on 17 August 1945, he did that on behalf also of the population of Netherlands New Guinea. But, as I has been stated many times before in this hall, there j was at that time no communication whatsoever between ] Netherlands N
ew Guinea and Indonesia. Java had been occupied in the war by the Japanese and at that time was still occupied, and there was not the slightest  possibility for anybody there at that moment to ascertain what the wishes of the population in Netherlands New Guinea were. It therefore seems only fair and - just to us that those who have so often and so eloquently pleaded here the cause of self-determination, and who have stated that a people should have the right to decide for itself whether it wants to belong to another country or whether it wants to be independent, should also apply that right to the people of Netherlands New Guinea. If Indonesia is right, if those people really do feel that they wish to be part of Indonesia, that will certainly appear at the time when the plebiscite—or whatever the form may be in which the population is consulted—takes place. If the Indonesian thesis is correct, it will appear so at that : time-. Therefore, I fail to see what objection Indonesia can possibly raise to our
preparing this population in the shortest possible time, as indicated by our Foreign Minister, for the exercise of that right which is laid I down in the Charter of the Organization and which has been defended by so many countries here.246.	The Foreign Minister of Indonesia, apart from pleading his own case, pointed to what he considered J some shortcomings in the thesis of the Netherlands and also in Netherlands actions. He said that, when we ; talk about the right of self-determination, we do not really mean it, I do not think that I need argue that ; point at all that is needed to refute that statement is to point to the fact that, a few years ago, the General Assembly accepted the new regulation of our Kingdom under which Surinam and the Netherlands Antilles were given complete self-government and were given a status entirely and exactly equal to that of the Kingdom in Europe. I think that is the best ; proof that we really do take the right of self-determi
