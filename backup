Based on the previous discussion, I test my hypothesis that overstaying leaders are more likely to experience extended regime survival compared to leaders who come to power through coups.
The regression outcome of Cox model and Time-dependent Cox presented in @tbl-cox.
We can see that the two models yield similar results, which means except GDP per caipita, the leader type does play a crucial role in leaders' survival time.
The hazard ratio for coup-entry leaders is 2.41 (exp(0.88)), signifying that coup-entry leaders are 1.49 times more likely to face ousting compared to overstaying leaders, all else being equal.
Additionally, the hazard ratio associated with the logarithm of GDP per capita is 0.73 (exp)-0.32), suggesting that a 1% increase in GDP per capita is correlated with a 27% reduction in the hazard of being ousted, or 1% decrease in GDP per capita is correlated with a 37% reduction in the hazard of being ousted.
It is noteworthy that the remaining variables did not exhibit statistical significance in this analysis.

The @fig-coxSurv illustrate the survival curves for the two types of leaders.
The survival curve for coup-entry leaders is significantly lower than that of overstaying leaders, indicating that overstaying leaders are more likely to survive longer compared to overstaying leaders.

The @fig-coxHR illustrates the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the variables in the Cox model. The hazard ratio for coup-entry leaders is 2.49, signifying that coup-entry leaders are 1.49 times more likely to face ousting compared to overstaying leaders, all else being equal.
Additionally, the hazard ratio associated with the logarithm of GDP per capita is 0.73, suggesting that a 1% increase in GDP per capita is correlated with a 27% reduction in the hazard of being ousted. It is noteworthy that the remaining variables did not exhibit statistical significance in this analysis.
